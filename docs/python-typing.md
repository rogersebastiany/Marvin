# Python typing

## 1. `typing` — Support for type hints

Added in version 3.5.

**Source code:** [Lib/typing.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/typing.py)

Note

The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations.
They can be used by third party tools such as [type checkers](../glossary.html#term-static-type-checker),
IDEs, linters, etc.

---

This module provides runtime support for type hints.

Consider the function below:

```
defsurface_area_of_cube(edge_length: float) -> str:
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6*edge_length**2}."
```

The function `surface_area_of_cube` takes an argument expected to
be an instance of [`float`](functions.html#float "float"), as indicated by the [type hint](../glossary.html#term-type-hint)
`edge_length: float`. The function is expected to return an instance
of [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"), as indicated by the `-> str` hint.

While type hints can be simple classes like [`float`](functions.html#float "float") or [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"),
they can also be more complex. The [`typing`](#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`).") module provides a vocabulary of
more advanced type hints.

New features are frequently added to the `typing` module.
The [typing\_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions/) package
provides backports of these new features to older versions of Python.

## Specification for the Python Type System

The canonical, up-to-date specification of the Python type system can be
found at [Specification for the Python type system](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/index.html).

## Type aliases

A type alias is defined using the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement, which creates
an instance of [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType"). In this example,
`Vector` and `list[float]` will be treated equivalently by static type
checkers:

```
type Vector = list[float]

defscale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# passes type checking; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])
```

Type aliases are useful for simplifying complex type signatures. For example:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Sequence

type ConnectionOptions = dict[str, str]
type Address = tuple[str, int]
type Server = tuple[Address, ConnectionOptions]

defbroadcast_message(message: str, servers: Sequence[Server]) -> None:
    ...

# The static type checker will treat the previous type signature as
# being exactly equivalent to this one.
defbroadcast_message(
    message: str,
    servers: Sequence[tuple[tuple[str, int], dict[str, str]]]
) -> None:
    ...
```

The [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement is new in Python 3.12. For backwards
compatibility, type aliases can also be created through simple assignment:

```
Vector = list[float]
```

Or marked with [`TypeAlias`](#typing.TypeAlias "typing.TypeAlias") to make it explicit that this is a type alias,
not a normal variable assignment:

```
fromtypingimport TypeAlias

Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]
```

## NewType

Use the [`NewType`](#typing.NewType "typing.NewType") helper to create distinct types:

```
fromtypingimport NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(524313)
```

The static type checker will treat the new type as if it were a subclass
of the original type. This is useful in helping catch logical errors:

```
defget_user_name(user_id: UserId) -> str:
    ...

# passes type checking
user_a = get_user_name(UserId(42351))

# fails type checking; an int is not a UserId
user_b = get_user_name(-1)
```

You may still perform all `int` operations on a variable of type `UserId`,
but the result will always be of type `int`. This lets you pass in a
`UserId` wherever an `int` might be expected, but will prevent you from
accidentally creating a `UserId` in an invalid way:

```
# 'output' is of type 'int', not 'UserId'
output = UserId(23413) + UserId(54341)
```

Note that these checks are enforced only by the static type checker. At runtime,
the statement `Derived = NewType('Derived', Base)` will make `Derived` a
callable that immediately returns whatever parameter you pass it. That means
the expression `Derived(some_value)` does not create a new class or introduce
much overhead beyond that of a regular function call.

More precisely, the expression `some_value is Derived(some_value)` is always
true at runtime.

It is invalid to create a subtype of `Derived`:

```
fromtypingimport NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

# Fails at runtime and does not pass type checking
classAdminUserId(UserId): pass
```

However, it is possible to create a [`NewType`](#typing.NewType "typing.NewType") based on a ‘derived’ `NewType`:

```
fromtypingimport NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

ProUserId = NewType('ProUserId', UserId)
```

and typechecking for `ProUserId` will work as expected.

See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more details.

Note

Recall that the use of a type alias declares two types to be *equivalent* to
one another. Doing `type Alias = Original` will make the static type checker
treat `Alias` as being *exactly equivalent* to `Original` in all cases.
This is useful when you want to simplify complex type signatures.

In contrast, `NewType` declares one type to be a *subtype* of another.
Doing `Derived = NewType('Derived', Original)` will make the static type
checker treat `Derived` as a *subclass* of `Original`, which means a
value of type `Original` cannot be used in places where a value of type
`Derived` is expected. This is useful when you want to prevent logic
errors with minimal runtime cost.

Added in version 3.5.2.

Changed in version 3.10: `NewType` is now a class rather than a function. As a result, there is
some additional runtime cost when calling `NewType` over a regular
function.

Changed in version 3.11: The performance of calling `NewType` has been restored to its level in
Python 3.9.

## Annotating callable objects

Functions – or other [callable](../glossary.html#term-callable) objects – can be annotated using
[`collections.abc.Callable`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Callable "collections.abc.Callable") or deprecated [`typing.Callable`](#typing.Callable "typing.Callable").
`Callable[[int], str]` signifies a function that takes a single parameter
of type [`int`](functions.html#int "int") and returns a [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str").

For example:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Callable, Awaitable

deffeeder(get_next_item: Callable[[], str]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

defasync_query(on_success: Callable[[int], None],
                on_error: Callable[[int, Exception], None]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

async defon_update(value: str) -> None:
    ...  # Body

callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]] = on_update
```

The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two values: the
argument list and the return type. The argument list must be a list of types,
a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec"), [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate "typing.Concatenate"), or an ellipsis (`...`). The return type must
be a single type.

If a literal ellipsis `...` is given as the argument list, it indicates that
a callable with any arbitrary parameter list would be acceptable:

```
defconcat(x: str, y: str) -> str:
    return x + y

x: Callable[..., str]
x = str     # OK
x = concat  # Also OK
```

`Callable` cannot express complex signatures such as functions that take a
variadic number of arguments, [overloaded functions](#overload), or
functions that have keyword-only parameters. However, these signatures can be
expressed by defining a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") class with a
[`__call__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "object.__call__") method:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterable
fromtypingimport Protocol

classCombiner(Protocol):
    def__call__(self, *vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]: ...

defbatch_proc(data: Iterable[bytes], cb_results: Combiner) -> bytes:
    for item in data:
        ...

defgood_cb(*vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...
defbad_cb(*vals: bytes, maxitems: int | None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...

batch_proc([], good_cb)  # OK
batch_proc([], bad_cb)   # Error! Argument 2 has incompatible type because of
                         # different name and kind in the callback
```

Callables which take other callables as arguments may indicate that their
parameter types are dependent on each other using [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec").
Additionally, if that callable adds or removes arguments from other
callables, the [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate "typing.Concatenate") operator may be used. They
take the form `Callable[ParamSpecVariable, ReturnType]` and
`Callable[Concatenate[Arg1Type, Arg2Type, ..., ParamSpecVariable], ReturnType]`
respectively.

Changed in version 3.10: `Callable` now supports [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") and [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate "typing.Concatenate").
See [**PEP 612**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) for more details.

See also

The documentation for [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") and [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate "typing.Concatenate") provides
examples of usage in `Callable`.

## Generics

Since type information about objects kept in containers cannot be statically
inferred in a generic way, many container classes in the standard library support
subscription to denote the expected types of container elements.

```
fromcollections.abcimport Mapping, Sequence

classEmployee: ...

# Sequence[Employee] indicates that all elements in the sequence
# must be instances of "Employee".
# Mapping[str, str] indicates that all keys and all values in the mapping
# must be strings.
defnotify_by_email(employees: Sequence[Employee],
                    overrides: Mapping[str, str]) -> None: ...
```

Generic functions and classes can be parameterized by using
[type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params):

```
fromcollections.abcimport Sequence

deffirst[T](l: Sequence[T]) -> T:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "T"
    return l[0]
```

Or by using the [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") factory directly:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Sequence
fromtypingimport TypeVar

U = TypeVar('U')                  # Declare type variable "U"

defsecond(l: Sequence[U]) -> U:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "U"
    return l[1]
```

Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics is new in Python 3.12.

## Annotating tuples

For most containers in Python, the typing system assumes that all elements in
the container will be of the same type. For example:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Mapping

# Type checker will infer that all elements in ``x`` are meant to be ints
x: list[int] = []

# Type checker error: ``list`` only accepts a single type argument:
y: list[int, str] = [1, 'foo']

# Type checker will infer that all keys in ``z`` are meant to be strings,
# and that all values in ``z`` are meant to be either strings or ints
z: Mapping[str, str | int] = {}
```

[`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list") only accepts one type argument, so a type checker would emit an
error on the `y` assignment above. Similarly,
[`Mapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping "collections.abc.Mapping") only accepts two type arguments: the first
indicates the type of the keys, and the second indicates the type of the
values.

Unlike most other Python containers, however, it is common in idiomatic Python
code for tuples to have elements which are not all of the same type. For this
reason, tuples are special-cased in Python’s typing system. [`tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")
accepts *any number* of type arguments:

```
# OK: ``x`` is assigned to a tuple of length 1 where the sole element is an int
x: tuple[int] = (5,)

# OK: ``y`` is assigned to a tuple of length 2;
# element 1 is an int, element 2 is a str
y: tuple[int, str] = (5, "foo")

# Error: the type annotation indicates a tuple of length 1,
# but ``z`` has been assigned to a tuple of length 3
z: tuple[int] = (1, 2, 3)
```

To denote a tuple which could be of *any* length, and in which all elements are
of the same type `T`, use the literal ellipsis `...`: `tuple[T, ...]`.
To denote an empty tuple, use
`tuple[()]`. Using plain `tuple` as an annotation is equivalent to using
`tuple[Any, ...]`:

```
x: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2)
# These reassignments are OK: ``tuple[int, ...]`` indicates x can be of any length
x = (1, 2, 3)
x = ()
# This reassignment is an error: all elements in ``x`` must be ints
x = ("foo", "bar")

# ``y`` can only ever be assigned to an empty tuple
y: tuple[()] = ()

z: tuple = ("foo", "bar")
# These reassignments are OK: plain ``tuple`` is equivalent to ``tuple[Any, ...]``
z = (1, 2, 3)
z = ()
```

## The type of class objects

A variable annotated with `C` may accept a value of type `C`. In
contrast, a variable annotated with `type[C]` (or deprecated
[`typing.Type[C]`](#typing.Type "typing.Type")) may accept values that are classes
themselves – specifically, it will accept the *class object* of `C`. For
example:

```
a = 3         # Has type ``int``
b = int       # Has type ``type[int]``
c = type(a)   # Also has type ``type[int]``
```

Note that `type[C]` is covariant:

```
classUser: ...
classProUser(User): ...
classTeamUser(User): ...

defmake_new_user(user_class: type[User]) -> User:
    # ...
    return user_class()

make_new_user(User)      # OK
make_new_user(ProUser)   # Also OK: ``type[ProUser]`` is a subtype of ``type[User]``
make_new_user(TeamUser)  # Still fine
make_new_user(User())    # Error: expected ``type[User]`` but got ``User``
make_new_user(int)       # Error: ``type[int]`` is not a subtype of ``type[User]``
```

The only legal parameters for [`type`](functions.html#type "type") are classes, [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any"),
[type variables](#generics), and unions of any of these types.
For example:

```
defnew_non_team_user(user_class: type[BasicUser | ProUser]): ...

new_non_team_user(BasicUser)  # OK
new_non_team_user(ProUser)    # OK
new_non_team_user(TeamUser)   # Error: ``type[TeamUser]`` is not a subtype
                              # of ``type[BasicUser | ProUser]``
new_non_team_user(User)       # Also an error
```

`type[Any]` is equivalent to [`type`](functions.html#type "type"), which is the root of Python’s
[metaclass hierarchy](../reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses).

## Annotating generators and coroutines

A generator can be annotated using the generic type
[`Generator[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Generator "collections.abc.Generator").
For example:

```
defecho_round() -> Generator[int, float, str]:
    sent = yield 0
    while sent >= 0:
        sent = yield round(sent)
    return 'Done'
```

Note that unlike many other generic classes in the standard library,
the `SendType` of [`Generator`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Generator "collections.abc.Generator") behaves
contravariantly, not covariantly or invariantly.

The `SendType` and `ReturnType` parameters default to `None`:

```
definfinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

It is also possible to set these types explicitly:

```
definfinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Simple generators that only ever yield values can also be annotated
as having a return type of either
[`Iterable[YieldType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterable "collections.abc.Iterable")
or [`Iterator[YieldType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterator "collections.abc.Iterator"):

```
definfinite_stream(start: int) -> Iterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Async generators are handled in a similar fashion, but don’t
expect a `ReturnType` type argument
([`AsyncGenerator[YieldType, SendType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.AsyncGenerator "collections.abc.AsyncGenerator")).
The `SendType` argument defaults to `None`, so the following definitions
are equivalent:

```
async definfinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)

async definfinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

As in the synchronous case,
[`AsyncIterable[YieldType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.AsyncIterable "collections.abc.AsyncIterable")
and [`AsyncIterator[YieldType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.AsyncIterator "collections.abc.AsyncIterator") are
available as well:

```
async definfinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncIterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

Coroutines can be annotated using
[`Coroutine[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Coroutine "collections.abc.Coroutine").
Generic arguments correspond to those of [`Generator`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Generator "collections.abc.Generator"),
for example:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Coroutine
c: Coroutine[list[str], str, int]  # Some coroutine defined elsewhere
x = c.send('hi')                   # Inferred type of 'x' is list[str]
async defbar() -> None:
    y = await c                    # Inferred type of 'y' is int
```

## User-defined generic types

A user-defined class can be defined as a generic class.

```
fromloggingimport Logger

classLoggedVar[T]:
    def__init__(self, value: T, name: str, logger: Logger) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.logger = logger
        self.value = value

    defset(self, new: T) -> None:
        self.log('Set ' + repr(self.value))
        self.value = new

    defget(self) -> T:
        self.log('Get ' + repr(self.value))
        return self.value

    deflog(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.logger.info('%s: %s', self.name, message)
```

This syntax indicates that the class `LoggedVar` is parameterised around a
single [type variable](#typevar) `T` . This also makes `T` valid as
a type within the class body.

Generic classes implicitly inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic"). For compatibility
with Python 3.11 and lower, it is also possible to inherit explicitly from
`Generic` to indicate a generic class:

```
fromtypingimport TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

classLoggedVar(Generic[T]):
    ...
```

Generic classes have [`__class_getitem__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") methods, meaning they
can be parameterised at runtime (e.g. `LoggedVar[int]` below):

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterable

defzero_all_vars(vars: Iterable[LoggedVar[int]]) -> None:
    for var in vars:
        var.set(0)
```

A generic type can have any number of type variables. All varieties of
[`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") are permissible as parameters for a generic type:

```
fromtypingimport TypeVar, Generic, Sequence

classWeirdTrio[T, B: Sequence[bytes], S: (int, str)]:
    ...

OldT = TypeVar('OldT', contravariant=True)
OldB = TypeVar('OldB', bound=Sequence[bytes], covariant=True)
OldS = TypeVar('OldS', int, str)

classOldWeirdTrio(Generic[OldT, OldB, OldS]):
    ...
```

Each type variable argument to [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") must be distinct.
This is thus invalid:

```
fromtypingimport TypeVar, Generic
...

classPair[M, M]:  # SyntaxError
    ...

T = TypeVar('T')

classPair(Generic[T, T]):   # INVALID
    ...
```

Generic classes can also inherit from other classes:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Sized

classLinkedList[T](Sized):
    ...
```

When inheriting from generic classes, some type parameters could be fixed:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Mapping

classMyDict[T](Mapping[str, T]):
    ...
```

In this case `MyDict` has a single parameter, `T`.

Using a generic class without specifying type parameters assumes
[`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") for each position. In the following example, `MyIterable` is
not generic but implicitly inherits from `Iterable[Any]`:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterable

classMyIterable(Iterable): # Same as Iterable[Any]
    ...
```

User-defined generic type aliases are also supported. Examples:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterable

type Response[S] = Iterable[S] | int

# Return type here is same as Iterable[str] | int
defresponse(query: str) -> Response[str]:
    ...

type Vec[T] = Iterable[tuple[T, T]]

definproduct[T: (int, float, complex)](v: Vec[T]) -> T: # Same as Iterable[tuple[T, T]]
    return sum(x*y for x, y in v)
```

For backward compatibility, generic type aliases can also be created
through a simple assignment:

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterable
fromtypingimport TypeVar

S = TypeVar("S")
Response = Iterable[S] | int
```

Changed in version 3.7: [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") no longer has a custom metaclass.

Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics and type aliases is new in version 3.12.
Previously, generic classes had to explicitly inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic")
or contain a type variable in one of their bases.

User-defined generics for parameter expressions are also supported via parameter
specification variables in the form `[**P]`. The behavior is consistent
with type variables’ described above as parameter specification variables are
treated by the `typing` module as a specialized type variable. The one exception
to this is that a list of types can be used to substitute a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec"):

```
>>> classZ[T, **P]: ...  # T is a TypeVar; P is a ParamSpec
...
>>> Z[int, [dict, float]]
__main__.Z[int, [dict, float]]
```

Classes generic over a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") can also be created using explicit
inheritance from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic"). In this case, `**` is not used:

```
fromtypingimport ParamSpec, Generic

P = ParamSpec('P')

classZ(Generic[P]):
    ...
```

Another difference between [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") and [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") is that a
generic with only one parameter specification variable will accept
parameter lists in the forms `X[[Type1, Type2, ...]]` and also
`X[Type1, Type2, ...]` for aesthetic reasons. Internally, the latter is converted
to the former, so the following are equivalent:

```
>>> classX[**P]: ...
...
>>> X[int, str]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
>>> X[[int, str]]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
```

Note that generics with [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") may not have correct
`__parameters__` after substitution in some cases because they
are intended primarily for static type checking.

Changed in version 3.10: [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") can now be parameterized over parameter expressions.
See [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") and [**PEP 612**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) for more details.

A user-defined generic class can have ABCs as base classes without a metaclass
conflict. Generic metaclasses are not supported. The outcome of parameterizing
generics is cached, and most types in the `typing` module are [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable) and
comparable for equality.

## The [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") type

A special kind of type is [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any"). A static type checker will treat
every type as being compatible with `Any` and `Any` as being
compatible with every type.

This means that it is possible to perform any operation or method call on a
value of type [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") and assign it to any variable:

```
fromtypingimport Any

a: Any = None
a = []          # OK
a = 2           # OK

s: str = ''
s = a           # OK

deffoo(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking; 'item' could be any type,
    # and that type might have a 'bar' method
    item.bar()
    ...
```

Notice that no type checking is performed when assigning a value of type
[`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") to a more precise type. For example, the static type checker did
not report an error when assigning `a` to `s` even though `s` was
declared to be of type [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str") and receives an [`int`](functions.html#int "int") value at
runtime!

Furthermore, all functions without a return type or parameter types will
implicitly default to using [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any"):

```
deflegacy_parser(text):
    ...
    return data

# A static type checker will treat the above
# as having the same signature as:
deflegacy_parser(text: Any) -> Any:
    ...
    return data
```

This behavior allows [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") to be used as an *escape hatch* when you
need to mix dynamically and statically typed code.

Contrast the behavior of [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") with the behavior of [`object`](functions.html#object "object").
Similar to `Any`, every type is a subtype of `object`. However,
unlike `Any`, the reverse is not true: `object` is *not* a
subtype of every other type.

That means when the type of a value is [`object`](functions.html#object "object"), a type checker will
reject almost all operations on it, and assigning it to a variable (or using
it as a return value) of a more specialized type is a type error. For example:

```
defhash_a(item: object) -> int:
    # Fails type checking; an object does not have a 'magic' method.
    item.magic()
    ...

defhash_b(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking
    item.magic()
    ...

# Passes type checking, since ints and strs are subclasses of object
hash_a(42)
hash_a("foo")

# Passes type checking, since Any is compatible with all types
hash_b(42)
hash_b("foo")
```

Use [`object`](functions.html#object "object") to indicate that a value could be any type in a typesafe
manner. Use [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") to indicate that a value is dynamically typed.

## Nominal vs structural subtyping

Initially [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) defined the Python static type system as using
*nominal subtyping*. This means that a class `A` is allowed where
a class `B` is expected if and only if `A` is a subclass of `B`.

This requirement previously also applied to abstract base classes, such as
[`Iterable`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterable "collections.abc.Iterable"). The problem with this approach is that a class had
to be explicitly marked to support them, which is unpythonic and unlike
what one would normally do in idiomatic dynamically typed Python code.
For example, this conforms to [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/):

```
fromcollections.abcimport Sized, Iterable, Iterator

classBucket(Sized, Iterable[int]):
    ...
    def__len__(self) -> int: ...
    def__iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...
```

[**PEP 544**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) solves this problem by allowing users to write
the above code without explicit base classes in the class definition,
allowing `Bucket` to be implicitly considered a subtype of both `Sized`
and `Iterable[int]` by static type checkers. This is known as
*structural subtyping* (or static duck-typing):

```
fromcollections.abcimport Iterator, Iterable

classBucket:  # Note: no base classes
    ...
    def__len__(self) -> int: ...
    def__iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...

defcollect(items: Iterable[int]) -> int: ...
result = collect(Bucket())  # Passes type check
```

Moreover, by subclassing a special class [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol"), a user
can define new custom protocols to fully enjoy structural subtyping
(see examples below).

## Module contents

The `typing` module defines the following classes, functions and decorators.

### Special typing primitives

#### Special types

These can be used as types in annotations. They do not support subscription
using `[]`.

typing.Any
:   Special type indicating an unconstrained type.

    * Every type is compatible with `Any`.
    * `Any` is compatible with every type.

    Changed in version 3.11: `Any` can now be used as a base class. This can be useful for
    avoiding type checker errors with classes that can duck type anywhere or
    are highly dynamic.

typing.AnyStr
:   A [constrained type variable](#typing-constrained-typevar).

    Definition:

    ```
    AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)
    ```

    `AnyStr` is meant to be used for functions that may accept [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str") or
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") arguments but cannot allow the two to mix.

    For example:

    ```
    defconcat(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
        return a + b

    concat("foo", "bar")    # OK, output has type 'str'
    concat(b"foo", b"bar")  # OK, output has type 'bytes'
    concat("foo", b"bar")   # Error, cannot mix str and bytes
    ```

    Note that, despite its name, `AnyStr` has nothing to do with the
    [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any") type, nor does it mean “any string”. In particular, `AnyStr`
    and `str | bytes` are different from each other and have different use
    cases:

    ```
    # Invalid use of AnyStr:
    # The type variable is used only once in the function signature,
    # so cannot be "solved" by the type checker
    defgreet_bad(cond: bool) -> AnyStr:
        return "hi there!" if cond else b"greetings!"

    # The better way of annotating this function:
    defgreet_proper(cond: bool) -> str | bytes:
        return "hi there!" if cond else b"greetings!"
    ```

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.18: Deprecated in favor of the new [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params).
    Use `class A[T: (str, bytes)]: ...` instead of importing `AnyStr`. See
    [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) for more details.

    In Python 3.16, `AnyStr` will be removed from `typing.__all__`, and
    deprecation warnings will be emitted at runtime when it is accessed or
    imported from `typing`. `AnyStr` will be removed from `typing`
    in Python 3.18.

typing.LiteralString
:   Special type that includes only literal strings.

    Any string
    literal is compatible with `LiteralString`, as is another
    `LiteralString`. However, an object typed as just `str` is not.
    A string created by composing `LiteralString`-typed objects
    is also acceptable as a `LiteralString`.

    Example:

    ```
    defrun_query(sql: LiteralString) -> None:
        ...

    defcaller(arbitrary_string: str, literal_string: LiteralString) -> None:
        run_query("SELECT * FROM students")  # OK
        run_query(literal_string)  # OK
        run_query("SELECT * FROM " + literal_string)  # OK
        run_query(arbitrary_string)  # type checker error
        run_query(  # type checker error
            f"SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = {arbitrary_string}"
        )
    ```

    `LiteralString` is useful for sensitive APIs where arbitrary user-generated
    strings could generate problems. For example, the two cases above
    that generate type checker errors could be vulnerable to an SQL
    injection attack.

    See [**PEP 675**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0675/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.Never

typing.NoReturn
:   `Never` and `NoReturn` represent the
    [bottom type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type),
    a type that has no members.

    They can be used to indicate that a function never returns,
    such as [`sys.exit()`](sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit"):

    ```
    fromtypingimport Never  # or NoReturn

    defstop() -> Never:
        raise RuntimeError('no way')
    ```

    Or to define a function that should never be
    called, as there are no valid arguments, such as
    [`assert_never()`](#typing.assert_never "typing.assert_never"):

    ```
    fromtypingimport Never  # or NoReturn

    defnever_call_me(arg: Never) -> None:
        pass

    defint_or_str(arg: int | str) -> None:
        never_call_me(arg)  # type checker error
        match arg:
            case int():
                print("It's an int")
            case str():
                print("It's a str")
            case_:
                never_call_me(arg)  # OK, arg is of type Never (or NoReturn)
    ```

    `Never` and `NoReturn` have the same meaning in the type system
    and static type checkers treat both equivalently.

    Added in version 3.6.2: Added `NoReturn`.

    Added in version 3.11: Added `Never`.

typing.Self
:   Special type to represent the current enclosed class.

    For example:

    ```
    fromtypingimport Self, reveal_type

    classFoo:
        defreturn_self(self) -> Self:
            ...
            return self

    classSubclassOfFoo(Foo): pass

    reveal_type(Foo().return_self())  # Revealed type is "Foo"
    reveal_type(SubclassOfFoo().return_self())  # Revealed type is "SubclassOfFoo"
    ```

    This annotation is semantically equivalent to the following,
    albeit in a more succinct fashion:

    ```
    fromtypingimport TypeVar

    Self = TypeVar("Self", bound="Foo")

    classFoo:
        defreturn_self(self: Self) -> Self:
            ...
            return self
    ```

    In general, if something returns `self`, as in the above examples, you
    should use `Self` as the return annotation. If `Foo.return_self` was
    annotated as returning `"Foo"`, then the type checker would infer the
    object returned from `SubclassOfFoo.return_self` as being of type `Foo`
    rather than `SubclassOfFoo`.

    Other common use cases include:

    * [`classmethod`](functions.html#classmethod "classmethod")s that are used as alternative constructors and return instances
      of the `cls` parameter.
    * Annotating an [`__enter__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method which returns self.

    You should not use `Self` as the return annotation if the method is not
    guaranteed to return an instance of a subclass when the class is
    subclassed:

    ```
    classEggs:
        # Self would be an incorrect return annotation here,
        # as the object returned is always an instance of Eggs,
        # even in subclasses
        defreturns_eggs(self) -> "Eggs":
            return Eggs()
    ```

    See [**PEP 673**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0673/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.TypeAlias
:   Special annotation for explicitly declaring a [type alias](#type-aliases).

    For example:

    ```
    fromtypingimport TypeAlias

    Factors: TypeAlias = list[int]
    ```

    `TypeAlias` is particularly useful on older Python versions for annotating
    aliases that make use of forward references, as it can be hard for type
    checkers to distinguish these from normal variable assignments:

    ```
    fromtypingimport Generic, TypeAlias, TypeVar

    T = TypeVar("T")

    # "Box" does not exist yet,
    # so we have to use quotes for the forward reference on Python <3.12.
    # Using ``TypeAlias`` tells the type checker that this is a type alias declaration,
    # not a variable assignment to a string.
    BoxOfStrings: TypeAlias = "Box[str]"

    classBox(Generic[T]):
        @classmethod
        defmake_box_of_strings(cls) -> BoxOfStrings: ...
    ```

    See [**PEP 613**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0613/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.10.

    Deprecated since version 3.12: `TypeAlias` is deprecated in favor of the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement,
    which creates instances of [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType")
    and which natively supports forward references.
    Note that while `TypeAlias` and `TypeAliasType` serve
    similar purposes and have similar names, they are distinct and the
    latter is not the type of the former.
    Removal of `TypeAlias` is not currently planned, but users
    are encouraged to migrate to `type` statements.

#### Special forms

These can be used as types in annotations. They all support subscription using
`[]`, but each has a unique syntax.

*class*typing.Union
:   Union type; `Union[X, Y]` is equivalent to `X | Y` and means either X or Y.

    To define a union, use e.g. `Union[int, str]` or the shorthand `int | str`. Using that shorthand is recommended. Details:

    * The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
    * Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.:

      ```
      Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]
      ```

      However, this does not apply to unions referenced through a type
      alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType"):

      ```
      type A = Union[int, str]
      Union[A, float] != Union[int, str, float]
      ```
    * Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.:

      ```
      Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int
      ```
    * Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.:

      ```
      Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str] == int | str
      ```
    * When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.:

      ```
      Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]
      ```
    * You cannot subclass or instantiate a `Union`.
    * You cannot write `Union[X][Y]`.

    Changed in version 3.7: Don’t remove explicit subclasses from unions at runtime.

    Changed in version 3.10: Unions can now be written as `X | Y`. See
    [union type expressions](stdtypes.html#types-union).

    Changed in version 3.14: [`types.UnionType`](types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is now an alias for `Union`, and both
    `Union[int, str]` and `int | str` create instances of the same class.
    To check whether an object is a `Union` at runtime, use
    `isinstance(obj, Union)`. For compatibility with earlier versions of
    Python, use
    `get_origin(obj) is typing.Union or get_origin(obj) is types.UnionType`.

typing.Optional
:   `Optional[X]` is equivalent to `X | None` (or `Union[X, None]`).

    Note that this is not the same concept as an optional argument,
    which is one that has a default. An optional argument with a
    default does not require the `Optional` qualifier on its type
    annotation just because it is optional. For example:

    ```
    deffoo(arg: int = 0) -> None:
        ...
    ```

    On the other hand, if an explicit value of `None` is allowed, the
    use of `Optional` is appropriate, whether the argument is optional
    or not. For example:

    ```
    deffoo(arg: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
        ...
    ```

    Changed in version 3.10: Optional can now be written as `X | None`. See
    [union type expressions](stdtypes.html#types-union).

typing.Concatenate
:   Special form for annotating higher-order functions.

    `Concatenate` can be used in conjunction with [Callable](#annotating-callables) and
    [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") to annotate a higher-order callable which adds, removes,
    or transforms parameters of another
    callable. Usage is in the form
    `Concatenate[Arg1Type, Arg2Type, ..., ParamSpecVariable]`. `Concatenate`
    is currently only valid when used as the first argument to a [Callable](#annotating-callables).
    The last parameter to `Concatenate` must be a `ParamSpec` or
    ellipsis (`...`).

    For example, to annotate a decorator `with_lock` which provides a
    [`threading.Lock`](threading.html#threading.Lock "threading.Lock") to the decorated function, `Concatenate` can be
    used to indicate that `with_lock` expects a callable which takes in a
    `Lock` as the first argument, and returns a callable with a different type
    signature. In this case, the [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec") indicates that the returned
    callable’s parameter types are dependent on the parameter types of the
    callable being passed in:

    ```
    fromcollections.abcimport Callable
    fromthreadingimport Lock
    fromtypingimport Concatenate

    # Use this lock to ensure that only one thread is executing a function
    # at any time.
    my_lock = Lock()

    defwith_lock[**P, R](f: Callable[Concatenate[Lock, P], R]) -> Callable[P, R]:
    '''A type-safe decorator which provides a lock.'''
        definner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> R:
            # Provide the lock as the first argument.
            return f(my_lock, *args, **kwargs)
        return inner

    @with_lock
    defsum_threadsafe(lock: Lock, numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    '''Add a list of numbers together in a thread-safe manner.'''
        with lock:
            return sum(numbers)

    # We don't need to pass in the lock ourselves thanks to the decorator.
    sum_threadsafe([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
    ```

    Added in version 3.10.

      `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate`)

    * [Annotating callable objects](#annotating-callables)

typing.Literal
:   Special typing form to define “literal types”.

    `Literal` can be used to indicate to type checkers that the
    annotated object has a value equivalent to one of the
    provided literals.

    For example:

    ```
    defvalidate_simple(data: Any) -> Literal[True]:  # always returns True
        ...

    type Mode = Literal['r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb']
    defopen_helper(file: str, mode: Mode) -> str:
        ...

    open_helper('/some/path', 'r')      # Passes type check
    open_helper('/other/path', 'typo')  # Error in type checker
    ```

    `Literal[...]` cannot be subclassed. At runtime, an arbitrary value
    is allowed as type argument to `Literal[...]`, but type checkers may
    impose restrictions. See [**PEP 586**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0586/) for more details about literal types.

    Additional details:

    * The arguments must be literal values and there must be at least one.
    * Nested `Literal` types are flattened, e.g.:

      ```
      assert Literal[Literal[1, 2], 3] == Literal[1, 2, 3]
      ```

      However, this does not apply to `Literal` types referenced through a type
      alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType"):

      ```
      type A = Literal[1, 2]
      assert Literal[A, 3] != Literal[1, 2, 3]
      ```
    * Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.:

      ```
      assert Literal[1, 2, 1] == Literal[1, 2]
      ```
    * When comparing literals, the argument order is ignored, e.g.:

      ```
      assert Literal[1, 2] == Literal[2, 1]
      ```
    * You cannot subclass or instantiate a `Literal`.
    * You cannot write `Literal[X][Y]`.

    Added in version 3.8.

    Changed in version 3.9.1: `Literal` now de-duplicates parameters. Equality comparisons of
    `Literal` objects are no longer order dependent. `Literal` objects
    will now raise a [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception during equality comparisons
    if one of their parameters are not [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable).

typing.ClassVar
:   Special type construct to mark class variables.

    As introduced in [**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/), a variable annotation wrapped in ClassVar
    indicates that a given attribute is intended to be used as a class variable
    and should not be set on instances of that class. Usage:

    ```
    classStarship:
        stats: ClassVar[dict[str, int]] = {} # class variable
        damage: int = 10                     # instance variable
    ```

    `ClassVar` accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.

    `ClassVar` is not a class itself, and should not
    be used with [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") or [`issubclass()`](functions.html#issubclass "issubclass").
    `ClassVar` does not change Python runtime behavior, but
    it can be used by third-party type checkers. For example, a type checker
    might flag the following code as an error:

    ```
    enterprise_d = Starship(3000)
    enterprise_d.stats = {} # Error, setting class variable on instance
    Starship.stats = {}     # This is OK
    ```

    Added in version 3.5.3.

    Changed in version 3.13: `ClassVar` can now be nested in [`Final`](#typing.Final "typing.Final") and vice versa.

typing.Final
:   Special typing construct to indicate final names to type checkers.

    Final names cannot be reassigned in any scope. Final names declared in class
    scopes cannot be overridden in subclasses.

    For example:

    ```
    MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
    MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker

    classConnection:
        TIMEOUT: Final[int] = 10

    classFastConnector(Connection):
        TIMEOUT = 1  # Error reported by type checker
    ```

    There is no runtime checking of these properties. See [**PEP 591**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0591/) for
    more details.

    Added in version 3.8.

    Changed in version 3.13: `Final` can now be nested in [`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar "typing.ClassVar") and vice versa.

typing.Required
:   Special typing construct to mark a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") key as required.

    This is mainly useful for `total=False` TypedDicts. See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict")
    and [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.NotRequired
:   Special typing construct to mark a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") key as potentially
    missing.

    See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") and [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.ReadOnly
:   A special typing construct to mark an item of a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") as read-only.

    For example:

    ```
    classMovie(TypedDict):
       title: ReadOnly[str]
       year: int

    defmutate_movie(m: Movie) -> None:
       m["year"] = 1999  # allowed
       m["title"] = "The Matrix"  # typechecker error
    ```

    There is no runtime checking for this property.

    See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") and [**PEP 705**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0705/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.13.

typing.Annotated
:   Special typing form to add context-specific metadata to an annotation.

    Add metadata `x` to a given type `T` by using the annotation
    `Annotated[T, x]`. Metadata added using `Annotated` can be used by
    static analysis tools or at runtime. At runtime, the metadata is stored
    in a `__metadata__` attribute.

    If a library or tool encounters an annotation `Annotated[T, x]` and has
    no special logic for the metadata, it should ignore the metadata and simply
    treat the annotation as `T`. As such, `Annotated` can be useful for code
    that wants to use annotations for purposes outside Python’s static typing
    system.

    Using `Annotated[T, x]` as an annotation still allows for static
    typechecking of `T`, as type checkers will simply ignore the metadata `x`.
    In this way, `Annotated` differs from the
    [`@no_type_check`](#typing.no_type_check "typing.no_type_check") decorator, which can also be used for
    adding annotations outside the scope of the typing system, but
    completely disables typechecking for a function or class.

    The responsibility of how to interpret the metadata
    lies with the tool or library encountering an
    `Annotated` annotation. A tool or library encountering an `Annotated` type
    can scan through the metadata elements to determine if they are of interest
    (e.g., using [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance")).

    Annotated[<type>, <metadata>]

    Here is an example of how you might use `Annotated` to add metadata to
    type annotations if you were doing range analysis:

    ```
    @dataclass
    classValueRange:
        lo: int
        hi: int

    T1 = Annotated[int, ValueRange(-10, 5)]
    T2 = Annotated[T1, ValueRange(-20, 3)]
    ```

    The first argument to `Annotated` must be a valid type. Multiple metadata
    elements can be supplied as `Annotated` supports variadic arguments. The
    order of the metadata elements is preserved and matters for equality checks:

    ```
    @dataclass
    classctype:
         kind: str

    a1 = Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")]
    a2 = Annotated[int, ctype("char"), ValueRange(3, 10)]

    assert a1 != a2  # Order matters
    ```

    It is up to the tool consuming the annotations to decide whether the
    client is allowed to add multiple metadata elements to one annotation and how to
    merge those annotations.

    Nested `Annotated` types are flattened. The order of the metadata elements
    starts with the innermost annotation:

    ```
    assert Annotated[Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10)], ctype("char")] == Annotated[
        int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")
    ]
    ```

    However, this does not apply to `Annotated` types referenced through a type
    alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType"):

    ```
    type From3To10[T] = Annotated[T, ValueRange(3, 10)]
    assert Annotated[From3To10[int], ctype("char")] != Annotated[
       int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")
    ]
    ```

    Duplicated metadata elements are not removed:

    ```
    assert Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10)] != Annotated[
        int, ValueRange(3, 10), ValueRange(3, 10)
    ]
    ```

    `Annotated` can be used with nested and generic aliases:

    > ```
    > @dataclass
    > classMaxLen:
    >     value: int
    >
    > type Vec[T] = Annotated[list[tuple[T, T]], MaxLen(10)]
    >
    > # When used in a type annotation, a type checker will treat "V" the same as
    > # ``Annotated[list[tuple[int, int]], MaxLen(10)]``:
    > type V = Vec[int]
    > ```

    `Annotated` cannot be used with an unpacked [`TypeVarTuple`](#typing.TypeVarTuple "typing.TypeVarTuple"):

    ```
    type Variadic[*Ts] = Annotated[*Ts, Ann1] = Annotated[T1, T2, T3, ..., Ann1]  # NOT valid
    ```

    where `T1`, `T2`, … are [`TypeVars`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar"). This is invalid as
    only one type should be passed to Annotated.

    By default, [`get_type_hints()`](#typing.get_type_hints "typing.get_type_hints") strips the metadata from annotations.
    Pass `include_extras=True` to have the metadata preserved:

    > ```
    > >>> fromtypingimport Annotated, get_type_hints
    > >>> deffunc(x: Annotated[int, "metadata"]) -> None: pass
    > ...
    > >>> get_type_hints(func)
    > {'x': <class 'int'>, 'return': <class 'NoneType'>}
    > >>> get_type_hints(func, include_extras=True)
    > {'x': typing.Annotated[int, 'metadata'], 'return': <class 'NoneType'>}
    > ```

    At runtime, the metadata associated with an `Annotated` type can be
    retrieved via the `__metadata__` attribute:

    > ```
    > >>> fromtypingimport Annotated
    > >>> X = Annotated[int, "very", "important", "metadata"]
    > >>> X
    > typing.Annotated[int, 'very', 'important', 'metadata']
    > >>> X.__metadata__
    > ('very', 'important', 'metadata')
    > ```

    If you want to retrieve the original type wrapped by `Annotated`, use the
    `__origin__` attribute:

    > ```
    > >>> fromtypingimport Annotated, get_origin
    > >>> Password = Annotated[str, "secret"]
    > >>> Password.__origin__
    > <class 'str'>
    > ```

    Note that using [`get_origin()`](#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin") will return `Annotated` itself:

    > ```
    > >>> get_origin(Password)
    > typing.Annotated
    > ```

    [**PEP 593**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0593/) - Flexible function and variable annotations
    :   The PEP introducing `Annotated` to the standard library.

    Added in version 3.9.

typing.TypeIs
:   Special typing construct for marking user-defined type predicate functions.

    `TypeIs` can be used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
    type predicate function. `TypeIs` only accepts a single type argument.
    At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean and take at
    least one positional argument.

    `TypeIs` aims to benefit *type narrowing* – a technique used by static
    type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
    program’s code flow. Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
    conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code. The
    conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a “type predicate”:

    ```
    defis_str(val: str | float):
        # "isinstance" type predicate
        if isinstance(val, str):
            # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
            ...
        else:
            # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
            ...
    ```

    Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
    as a type predicate. Such a function should use `TypeIs[...]` or
    [`TypeGuard`](#typing.TypeGuard "typing.TypeGuard") as its return type to alert static type checkers to
    this intention. `TypeIs` usually has more intuitive behavior than
    `TypeGuard`, but it cannot be used when the input and output types
    are incompatible (e.g., `list[object]` to `list[int]`) or when the
    function does not return `True` for all instances of the narrowed type.

    Using `-> TypeIs[NarrowedType]` tells the static type checker that for a given
    function:

    1. The return value is a boolean.
    2. If the return value is `True`, the type of its argument
       is the intersection of the argument’s original type and `NarrowedType`.
    3. If the return value is `False`, the type of its argument
       is narrowed to exclude `NarrowedType`.

    For example:

    ```
    fromtypingimport assert_type, final, TypeIs

    classParent: pass
    classChild(Parent): pass
    @final
    classUnrelated: pass

    defis_parent(val: object) -> TypeIs[Parent]:
        return isinstance(val, Parent)

    defrun(arg: Child | Unrelated):
        if is_parent(arg):
            # Type of ``arg`` is narrowed to the intersection
            # of ``Parent`` and ``Child``, which is equivalent to
            # ``Child``.
            assert_type(arg, Child)
        else:
            # Type of ``arg`` is narrowed to exclude ``Parent``,
            # so only ``Unrelated`` is left.
            assert_type(arg, Unrelated)
    ```

    The type inside `TypeIs` must be consistent with the type of the
    function’s argument; if it is not, static type checkers will raise
    an error. An incorrectly written `TypeIs` function can lead to
    unsound behavior in the type system; it is the user’s responsibility
    to write such functions in a type-safe manner.

    If a `TypeIs` function is a class or instance method, then the type in
    `TypeIs` maps to the type of the second parameter (after `cls` or
    `self`).

    In short, the form `def foo(arg: TypeA) -> TypeIs[TypeB]: ...`,
    means that if `foo(arg)` returns `True`, then `arg` is an instance
    of `TypeB`, and if it returns `False`, it is not an instance of `TypeB`.

    `TypeIs` also works with type variables. For more information, see
    [**PEP 742**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/) (Narrowing types with `TypeIs`).

    Added in version 3.13.

typing.TypeGuard
:   Special typing construct for marking user-defined type predicate functions.

    Type predicate functions are user-defined functions that return whether their
    argument is an instance of a particular type.
    `TypeGuard` works similarly to [`TypeIs`](#typing.TypeIs "typing.TypeIs"), but has subtly different
    effects on type checking behavior (see below).

    Using `-> TypeGuard` tells the static type checker that for a given
    function:

    1. The return value is a boolean.
    2. If the return value is `True`, the type of its argument
       is the type inside `TypeGuard`.

    `TypeGuard` also works with type variables. See [**PEP 647**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0647/) for more details.

    For example:

    ```
    defis_str_list(val: list[object]) -> TypeGuard[list[str]]:
    '''Determines whether all objects in the list are strings'''
        return all(isinstance(x, str) for x in val)

    deffunc1(val: list[object]):
        if is_str_list(val):
            # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``list[str]``.
            print(" ".join(val))
        else:
            # Type of ``val`` remains as ``list[object]``.
            print("Not a list of strings!")
    ```

    `TypeIs` and `TypeGuard` differ in the following ways:

    * `TypeIs` requires the narrowed type to be a subtype of the input type, while
      `TypeGuard` does not. The main reason is to allow for things like
      narrowing `list[object]` to `list[str]` even though the latter
      is not a subtype of the former, since `list` is invariant.
    * When a `TypeGuard` function returns `True`, type checkers narrow the type of the
      variable to exactly the `TypeGuard` type. When a `TypeIs` function returns `True`,
      type checkers can infer a more precise type combining the previously known type of the
      variable with the `TypeIs` type. (Technically, this is known as an intersection type.)
    * When a `TypeGuard` function returns `False`, type checkers cannot narrow the type of
      the variable at all. When a `TypeIs` function returns `False`, type checkers can narrow
      the type of the variable to exclude the `TypeIs` type.

    Added in version 3.10.

typing.Unpack
:   Typing operator to conceptually mark an object as having been unpacked.

    For example, using the unpack operator `*` on a
    [type variable tuple](#typevartuple) is equivalent to using `Unpack`
    to mark the type variable tuple as having been unpacked:

    ```
    Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
    tup: tuple[*Ts]
    # Effectively does:
    tup: tuple[Unpack[Ts]]
    ```

    In fact, `Unpack` can be used interchangeably with `*` in the context
    of [`typing.TypeVarTuple`](#typing.TypeVarTuple "typing.TypeVarTuple") and
    [`builtins.tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") types. You might see `Unpack` being used
    explicitly in older versions of Python, where `*` couldn’t be used in
    certain places:

    ```
    # In older versions of Python, TypeVarTuple and Unpack
    # are located in the `typing_extensions` backports package.
    fromtyping_extensionsimport TypeVarTuple, Unpack

    Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
    tup: tuple[*Ts]         # Syntax error on Python <= 3.10!
    tup: tuple[Unpack[Ts]]  # Semantically equivalent, and backwards-compatible
    ```

    `Unpack` can also be used along with [`typing.TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict") for typing
    `**kwargs` in a function signature:

    ```
    fromtypingimport TypedDict, Unpack

    classMovie(TypedDict):
        name: str
        year: int

    # This function expects two keyword arguments - `name` of type `str`
    # and `year` of type `int`.
    deffoo(**kwargs: Unpack[Movie]): ...
    ```

    See [**PEP 692**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/) for more details on using `Unpack` for `**kwargs` typing.

    Added in version 3.11.

#### Building generic types and type aliases

The following classes should not be used directly as annotations.
Their intended purpose is to be building blocks
for creating generic types and type aliases.

These objects can be created through special syntax
([type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) and the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement).
For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, they can also be created
without the dedicated syntax, as documented below.

*class*typing.Generic
:   Abstract base class for generic types.

    A generic type is typically declared by adding a list of type parameters
    after the class name:

    ```
    classMapping[KT, VT]:
        def__getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:
            ...
            # Etc.
    ```

    Such a class implicitly inherits from `Generic`.
    The runtime semantics of this syntax are discussed in the
    [Language Reference](../reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes).

    This class can then be used as follows:

    ```
    deflookup_name[X, Y](mapping: Mapping[X, Y], key: X, default: Y) -> Y:
        try:
            return mapping[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default
    ```

    Here the brackets after the function name indicate a
    [generic function](../reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions).

    For backwards compatibility, generic classes can also be
    declared by explicitly inheriting from
    `Generic`. In this case, the type parameters must be declared
    separately:

    ```
    KT = TypeVar('KT')
    VT = TypeVar('VT')

    classMapping(Generic[KT, VT]):
        def__getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:
            ...
            # Etc.
    ```

*class*typing.TypeVar(*name*, *\*constraints*, *bound=None*, *covariant=False*, *contravariant=False*, *infer\_variance=False*, *default=typing.NoDefault*)
:   Type variable.

    The preferred way to construct a type variable is via the dedicated syntax
    for [generic functions](../reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions),
    [generic classes](../reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes), and
    [generic type aliases](../reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-type-aliases):

    ```
    classSequence[T]:  # T is a TypeVar
        ...
    ```

    This syntax can also be used to create bounded and constrained type
    variables:

    ```
    classStrSequence[S: str]:  # S is a TypeVar with a `str` upper bound;
        ...                     # we can say that S is "bounded by `str`"

    classStrOrBytesSequence[A: (str, bytes)]:  # A is a TypeVar constrained to str or bytes
        ...
    ```

    However, if desired, reusable type variables can also be constructed manually, like so:

    ```
    T = TypeVar('T')  # Can be anything
    S = TypeVar('S', bound=str)  # Can be any subtype of str
    A = TypeVar('A', str, bytes)  # Must be exactly str or bytes
    ```

    Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type
    checkers. They serve as the parameters for generic types as well
    as for generic function and type alias definitions.
    See [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") for more
    information on generic types. Generic functions work as follows:

    ```
    defrepeat[T](x: T, n: int) -> Sequence[T]:
    """Return a list containing n references to x."""
        return [x]*n

    defprint_capitalized[S: str](x: S) -> S:
    """Print x capitalized, and return x."""
        print(x.capitalize())
        return x

    defconcatenate[A: (str, bytes)](x: A, y: A) -> A:
    """Add two strings or bytes objects together."""
        return x + y
    ```

    Note that type variables can be *bounded*, *constrained*, or neither, but
    cannot be both bounded *and* constrained.

    The variance of type variables is inferred by type checkers when they are created
    through the [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) or when
    `infer_variance=True` is passed.
    Manually created type variables may be explicitly marked covariant or contravariant by passing
    `covariant=True` or `contravariant=True`.
    By default, manually created type variables are invariant.
    See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) for more details.

    Bounded type variables and constrained type variables have different
    semantics in several important ways. Using a *bounded* type variable means
    that the `TypeVar` will be solved using the most specific type possible:

    ```
    x = print_capitalized('a string')
    reveal_type(x)  # revealed type is str

    classStringSubclass(str):
        pass

    y = print_capitalized(StringSubclass('another string'))
    reveal_type(y)  # revealed type is StringSubclass

    z = print_capitalized(45)  # error: int is not a subtype of str
    ```

    The upper bound of a type variable can be a concrete type, abstract type
    (ABC or Protocol), or even a union of types:

    ```
    # Can be anything with an __abs__ method
    defprint_abs[T: SupportsAbs](arg: T) -> None:
        print("Absolute value:", abs(arg))

    U = TypeVar('U', bound=str|bytes)  # Can be any subtype of the union str|bytes
    V = TypeVar('V', bound=SupportsAbs)  # Can be anything with an __abs__ method
    ```

    Using a *constrained* type variable, however, means that the `TypeVar`
    can only ever be solved as being exactly one of the constraints given:

    ```
    a = concatenate('one', 'two')
    reveal_type(a)  # revealed type is str

    b = concatenate(StringSubclass('one'), StringSubclass('two'))
    reveal_type(b)  # revealed type is str, despite StringSubclass being passed in

    c = concatenate('one', b'two')  # error: type variable 'A' can be either str or bytes in a function call, but not both
    ```

    At runtime, `isinstance(x, T)` will raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

    \_\_name\_\_
    :   The name of the type variable.

    \_\_covariant\_\_
    :   Whether the type var has been explicitly marked as covariant.

    \_\_contravariant\_\_
    :   Whether the type var has been explicitly marked as contravariant.

    \_\_infer\_variance\_\_
    :   Whether the type variable’s variance should be inferred by type checkers.

        Added in version 3.12.

    \_\_bound\_\_
    :   The upper bound of the type variable, if any.

        Changed in version 3.12: For type variables created through [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params),
        the bound is evaluated only when the attribute is accessed, not when
        the type variable is created (see [Lazy evaluation](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation)).

    evaluate\_bound()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__bound__`](#typing.TypeVar.__bound__ "typing.TypeVar.__bound__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__bound__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format.

        Added in version 3.14.

    \_\_constraints\_\_
    :   A tuple containing the constraints of the type variable, if any.

        Changed in version 3.12: For type variables created through [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params),
        the constraints are evaluated only when the attribute is accessed, not when
        the type variable is created (see [Lazy evaluation](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation)).

    evaluate\_constraints()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__constraints__`](#typing.TypeVar.__constraints__ "typing.TypeVar.__constraints__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__constraints__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format.

        Added in version 3.14.

    \_\_default\_\_
    :   The default value of the type variable, or [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault") if it
        has no default.

        Added in version 3.13.

    evaluate\_default()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVar.__default__ "typing.TypeVar.__default__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__default__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format.

        Added in version 3.14.

    has\_default()
    :   Return whether or not the type variable has a default value. This is equivalent
        to checking whether [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVar.__default__ "typing.TypeVar.__default__") is not the [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault")
        singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
        [lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation) default value.

        Added in version 3.13.

    Changed in version 3.12: Type variables can now be declared using the
    [type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).
    The `infer_variance` parameter was added.

    Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

*class*typing.TypeVarTuple(*name*, *\**, *default=typing.NoDefault*)
:   Type variable tuple. A specialized form of [type variable](#typevar)
    that enables *variadic* generics.

    Type variable tuples can be declared in [type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params)
    using a single asterisk (`*`) before the name:

    ```
    defmove_first_element_to_last[T, *Ts](tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:
        return (*tup[1:], tup[0])
    ```

    Or by explicitly invoking the `TypeVarTuple` constructor:

    ```
    T = TypeVar("T")
    Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")

    defmove_first_element_to_last(tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:
        return (*tup[1:], tup[0])
    ```

    A normal type variable enables parameterization with a single type. A type
    variable tuple, in contrast, allows parameterization with an
    *arbitrary* number of types by acting like an *arbitrary* number of type
    variables wrapped in a tuple. For example:

    ```
    # T is bound to int, Ts is bound to ()
    # Return value is (1,), which has type tuple[int]
    move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1,))

    # T is bound to int, Ts is bound to (str,)
    # Return value is ('spam', 1), which has type tuple[str, int]
    move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1, 'spam'))

    # T is bound to int, Ts is bound to (str, float)
    # Return value is ('spam', 3.0, 1), which has type tuple[str, float, int]
    move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1, 'spam', 3.0))

    # This fails to type check (and fails at runtime)
    # because tuple[()] is not compatible with tuple[T, *Ts]
    # (at least one element is required)
    move_first_element_to_last(tup=())
    ```

    Note the use of the unpacking operator `*` in `tuple[T, *Ts]`.
    Conceptually, you can think of `Ts` as a tuple of type variables
    `(T1, T2, ...)`. `tuple[T, *Ts]` would then become
    `tuple[T, *(T1, T2, ...)]`, which is equivalent to
    `tuple[T, T1, T2, ...]`. (Note that in older versions of Python, you might
    see this written using [`Unpack`](#typing.Unpack "typing.Unpack") instead, as
    `Unpack[Ts]`.)

    Type variable tuples must *always* be unpacked. This helps distinguish type
    variable tuples from normal type variables:

    ```
    x: Ts          # Not valid
    x: tuple[Ts]   # Not valid
    x: tuple[*Ts]  # The correct way to do it
    ```

    Type variable tuples can be used in the same contexts as normal type
    variables. For example, in class definitions, arguments, and return types:

    ```
    classArray[*Shape]:
        def__getitem__(self, key: tuple[*Shape]) -> float: ...
        def__abs__(self) -> "Array[*Shape]": ...
        defget_shape(self) -> tuple[*Shape]: ...
    ```

    Type variable tuples can be happily combined with normal type variables:

    ```
    classArray[DType, *Shape]:  # This is fine
        pass

    classArray2[*Shape, DType]:  # This would also be fine
        pass

    classHeight: ...
    classWidth: ...

    float_array_1d: Array[float, Height] = Array()     # Totally fine
    int_array_2d: Array[int, Height, Width] = Array()  # Yup, fine too
    ```

    However, note that at most one type variable tuple may appear in a single
    list of type arguments or type parameters:

    ```
    x: tuple[*Ts, *Ts]            # Not valid
    classArray[*Shape, *Shape]:  # Not valid
        pass
    ```

    Finally, an unpacked type variable tuple can be used as the type annotation
    of `*args`:

    ```
    defcall_soon[*Ts](
        callback: Callable[[*Ts], None],
        *args: *Ts
    ) -> None:
        ...
        callback(*args)
    ```

    In contrast to non-unpacked annotations of `*args` - e.g. `*args: int`,
    which would specify that *all* arguments are `int` - `*args: *Ts`
    enables reference to the types of the *individual* arguments in `*args`.
    Here, this allows us to ensure the types of the `*args` passed
    to `call_soon` match the types of the (positional) arguments of
    `callback`.

    See [**PEP 646**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/) for more details on type variable tuples.

    \_\_name\_\_
    :   The name of the type variable tuple.

    \_\_default\_\_
    :   The default value of the type variable tuple, or [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault") if it
        has no default.

        Added in version 3.13.

    evaluate\_default()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVarTuple.__default__ "typing.TypeVarTuple.__default__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__default__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format.

        Added in version 3.14.

    has\_default()
    :   Return whether or not the type variable tuple has a default value. This is equivalent
        to checking whether [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVarTuple.__default__ "typing.TypeVarTuple.__default__") is not the [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault")
        singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
        [lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation) default value.

        Added in version 3.13.

    Added in version 3.11.

    Changed in version 3.12: Type variable tuples can now be declared using the
    [type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).

    Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

*class*typing.ParamSpec(*name*, *\**, *bound=None*, *covariant=False*, *contravariant=False*, *default=typing.NoDefault*)
:   Parameter specification variable. A specialized version of
    [type variables](#typevar).

    In [type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params), parameter specifications
    can be declared with two asterisks (`**`):

    ```
    type IntFunc[**P] = Callable[P, int]
    ```

    For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, `ParamSpec` objects
    can also be created as follows:

    ```
    P = ParamSpec('P')
    ```

    Parameter specification variables exist primarily for the benefit of static
    type checkers. They are used to forward the parameter types of one
    callable to another callable – a pattern commonly found in higher order
    functions and decorators. They are only valid when used in `Concatenate`,
    or as the first argument to `Callable`, or as parameters for user-defined
    Generics. See [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") for more information on generic types.

    For example, to add basic logging to a function, one can create a decorator
    `add_logging` to log function calls. The parameter specification variable
    tells the type checker that the callable passed into the decorator and the
    new callable returned by it have inter-dependent type parameters:

    ```
    fromcollections.abcimport Callable
    importlogging

    defadd_logging[T, **P](f: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
    '''A type-safe decorator to add logging to a function.'''
        definner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
            logging.info(f'{f.__name__} was called')
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return inner

    @add_logging
    defadd_two(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    '''Add two numbers together.'''
        return x + y
    ```

    Without `ParamSpec`, the simplest way to annotate this previously was to
    use a [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar") with upper bound `Callable[..., Any]`. However this
    causes two problems:

    1. The type checker can’t type check the `inner` function because
       `*args` and `**kwargs` have to be typed [`Any`](#typing.Any "typing.Any").
    2. [`cast()`](#typing.cast "typing.cast") may be required in the body of the `add_logging`
       decorator when returning the `inner` function, or the static type
       checker must be told to ignore the `return inner`.

    args

    kwargs
    :   Since `ParamSpec` captures both positional and keyword parameters,
        `P.args` and `P.kwargs` can be used to split a `ParamSpec` into its
        components. `P.args` represents the tuple of positional parameters in a
        given call and should only be used to annotate `*args`. `P.kwargs`
        represents the mapping of keyword parameters to their values in a given call,
        and should be only be used to annotate `**kwargs`. Both
        attributes require the annotated parameter to be in scope. At runtime,
        `P.args` and `P.kwargs` are instances respectively of
        [`ParamSpecArgs`](#typing.ParamSpecArgs "typing.ParamSpecArgs") and [`ParamSpecKwargs`](#typing.ParamSpecKwargs "typing.ParamSpecKwargs").

    \_\_name\_\_
    :   The name of the parameter specification.

    \_\_default\_\_
    :   The default value of the parameter specification, or [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault") if it
        has no default.

        Added in version 3.13.

    evaluate\_default()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__default__`](#typing.ParamSpec.__default__ "typing.ParamSpec.__default__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__default__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format.

        Added in version 3.14.

    has\_default()
    :   Return whether or not the parameter specification has a default value. This is equivalent
        to checking whether [`__default__`](#typing.ParamSpec.__default__ "typing.ParamSpec.__default__") is not the [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault "typing.NoDefault")
        singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
        [lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation) default value.

        Added in version 3.13.

    Parameter specification variables created with `covariant=True` or
    `contravariant=True` can be used to declare covariant or contravariant
    generic types. The `bound` argument is also accepted, similar to
    [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar "typing.TypeVar"). However the actual semantics of these keywords are yet to
    be decided.

    Added in version 3.10.

    Changed in version 3.12: Parameter specifications can now be declared using the
    [type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).

    Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

    Note

    Only parameter specification variables defined in global scope can
    be pickled.

      `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate`)

    * [Annotating callable objects](#annotating-callables)

typing.ParamSpecArgs

typing.ParamSpecKwargs
:   Arguments and keyword arguments attributes of a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec"). The
    `P.args` attribute of a `ParamSpec` is an instance of `ParamSpecArgs`,
    and `P.kwargs` is an instance of `ParamSpecKwargs`. They are intended
    for runtime introspection and have no special meaning to static type checkers.

    Calling [`get_origin()`](#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin") on either of these objects will return the
    original `ParamSpec`:

    ```
    >>> fromtypingimport ParamSpec, get_origin
    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")
    >>> get_origin(P.args) is P
    True
    >>> get_origin(P.kwargs) is P
    True
    ```

    Added in version 3.10.

*class*typing.TypeAliasType(*name*, *value*, *\**, *type\_params=()*)
:   The type of type aliases created through the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#type) statement.

    Example:

    ```
    >>> type Alias = int
    >>> type(Alias)
    <class 'typing.TypeAliasType'>
    ```

    Added in version 3.12.

    \_\_name\_\_
    :   The name of the type alias:

        ```
        >>> type Alias = int
        >>> Alias.__name__
        'Alias'
        ```

    \_\_module\_\_
    :   The name of the module in which the type alias was defined:

        ```
        >>> type Alias = int
        >>> Alias.__module__
        '__main__'
        ```

    \_\_type\_params\_\_
    :   The type parameters of the type alias, or an empty tuple if the alias is
        not generic:

        ```
        >>> type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]
        >>> ListOrSet.__type_params__
        (T,)
        >>> type NotGeneric = int
        >>> NotGeneric.__type_params__
        ()
        ```

    \_\_value\_\_
    :   The type alias’s value. This is [lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation),
        so names used in the definition of the alias are not resolved until the
        `__value__` attribute is accessed:

        ```
        >>> type Mutually = Recursive
        >>> type Recursive = Mutually
        >>> Mutually
        Mutually
        >>> Recursive
        Recursive
        >>> Mutually.__value__
        Recursive
        >>> Recursive.__value__
        Mutually
        ```

    evaluate\_value()
    :   An [evaluate function](../glossary.html#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__value__`](#typing.TypeAliasType.__value__ "typing.TypeAliasType.__value__") attribute.
        When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
        format, which is equivalent to accessing the `__value__` attribute directly,
        but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function "annotationlib.call_evaluate_function")
        to evaluate the value in a different format:

        ```
        >>> type Alias = undefined
        >>> Alias.__value__
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        NameError: name 'undefined' is not defined
        >>> fromannotationlibimport Format, call_evaluate_function
        >>> Alias.evaluate_value(Format.VALUE)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        NameError: name 'undefined' is not defined
        >>> call_evaluate_function(Alias.evaluate_value, Format.FORWARDREF)
        ForwardRef('undefined')
        ```

        Added in version 3.14.

    Unpacking

    Type aliases support star unpacking using the `*Alias` syntax.
    This is equivalent to using `Unpack[Alias]` directly:

    ```
    >>> type Alias = tuple[int, str]
    >>> type Unpacked = tuple[bool, *Alias]
    >>> Unpacked.__value__
    tuple[bool, typing.Unpack[Alias]]
    ```

    Added in version 3.14.

#### Other special directives

These functions and classes should not be used directly as annotations.
Their intended purpose is to be building blocks for creating and declaring
types.

*class*typing.NamedTuple
:   Typed version of [`collections.namedtuple()`](collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple").

    Usage:

    ```
    classEmployee(NamedTuple):
        name: str
        id: int
    ```

    This is equivalent to:

    ```
    Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id'])
    ```

    To give a field a default value, you can assign to it in the class body:

    ```
    classEmployee(NamedTuple):
        name: str
        id: int = 3

    employee = Employee('Guido')
    assert employee.id == 3
    ```

    Fields with a default value must come after any fields without a default.

    The resulting class has an extra attribute `__annotations__` giving a
    dict that maps the field names to the field types. (The field names are in
    the `_fields` attribute and the default values are in the
    `_field_defaults` attribute, both of which are part of the [`namedtuple()`](collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple")
    API.)

    `NamedTuple` subclasses can also have docstrings and methods:

    ```
    classEmployee(NamedTuple):
    """Represents an employee."""
        name: str
        id: int = 3

        def__repr__(self) -> str:
            return f'<Employee {self.name}, id={self.id}>'
    ```

    `NamedTuple` subclasses can be generic:

    ```
    classGroup[T](NamedTuple):
        key: T
        group: list[T]
    ```

    Backward-compatible usage:

    ```
    # For creating a generic NamedTuple on Python 3.11
    T = TypeVar("T")

    classGroup(NamedTuple, Generic[T]):
        key: T
        group: list[T]

    # A functional syntax is also supported
    Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', [('name', str), ('id', int)])
    ```

    Changed in version 3.6: Added support for [**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) variable annotation syntax.

    Changed in version 3.6.1: Added support for default values, methods, and docstrings.

    Changed in version 3.8: The `_field_types` and `__annotations__` attributes are
    now regular dictionaries instead of instances of `OrderedDict`.

    Changed in version 3.9: Removed the `_field_types` attribute in favor of the more
    standard `__annotations__` attribute which has the same information.

    Changed in version 3.9: `NamedTuple` is now a function rather than a class.
    It can still be used as a class base, as described above.

    Changed in version 3.11: Added support for generic namedtuples.

    Changed in version 3.14: Using [`super()`](functions.html#super "super") (and the `__class__` [closure variable](../glossary.html#term-closure-variable)) in methods of `NamedTuple` subclasses
    is unsupported and causes a [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating NamedTuple classes
    (`NT = NamedTuple("NT", x=int)`) is deprecated, and will be disallowed
    in 3.15. Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: When using the functional syntax to create a NamedTuple class, failing to
    pass a value to the ‘fields’ parameter (`NT = NamedTuple("NT")`) is
    deprecated. Passing `None` to the ‘fields’ parameter
    (`NT = NamedTuple("NT", None)`) is also deprecated. Both will be
    disallowed in Python 3.15. To create a NamedTuple class with 0 fields,
    use `class NT(NamedTuple): pass` or `NT = NamedTuple("NT", [])`.

*class*typing.NewType(*name*, *tp*)
:   Helper class to create low-overhead [distinct types](#distinct).

    A `NewType` is considered a distinct type by a typechecker. At runtime,
    however, calling a `NewType` returns its argument unchanged.

    Usage:

    ```
    UserId = NewType('UserId', int)  # Declare the NewType "UserId"
    first_user = UserId(1)  # "UserId" returns the argument unchanged at runtime
    ```

    \_\_module\_\_
    :   The name of the module in which the new type is defined.

    \_\_name\_\_
    :   The name of the new type.

    \_\_supertype\_\_
    :   The type that the new type is based on.

    Added in version 3.5.2.

    Changed in version 3.10: `NewType` is now a class rather than a function.

*class*typing.Protocol(*Generic*)
:   Base class for protocol classes.

    Protocol classes are defined like this:

    ```
    classProto(Protocol):
        defmeth(self) -> int:
            ...
    ```

    Such classes are primarily used with static type checkers that recognize
    structural subtyping (static duck-typing), for example:

    ```
    classC:
        defmeth(self) -> int:
            return 0

    deffunc(x: Proto) -> int:
        return x.meth()

    func(C())  # Passes static type check
    ```

    See [**PEP 544**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) for more details. Protocol classes decorated with
    [`runtime_checkable()`](#typing.runtime_checkable "typing.runtime_checkable") (described later) act as simple-minded runtime
    protocols that check only the presence of given attributes, ignoring their
    type signatures. Protocol classes without this decorator cannot be used
    as the second argument to [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") or [`issubclass()`](functions.html#issubclass "issubclass").

    Protocol classes can be generic, for example:

    ```
    classGenProto[T](Protocol):
        defmeth(self) -> T:
            ...
    ```

    In code that needs to be compatible with Python 3.11 or older, generic
    Protocols can be written as follows:

    ```
    T = TypeVar("T")

    classGenProto(Protocol[T]):
        defmeth(self) -> T:
            ...
    ```

    Added in version 3.8.

@typing.runtime\_checkable
:   Mark a protocol class as a runtime protocol.

    Such a protocol can be used with [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") and [`issubclass()`](functions.html#issubclass "issubclass").
    This allows a simple-minded structural check, very similar to “one trick ponies”
    in [`collections.abc`](collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers") such as [`Iterable`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterable "collections.abc.Iterable"). For example:

    ```
    @runtime_checkable
    classClosable(Protocol):
        defclose(self): ...

    assert isinstance(open('/some/file'), Closable)

    @runtime_checkable
    classNamed(Protocol):
        name: str

    importthreading
    assert isinstance(threading.Thread(name='Bob'), Named)
    ```

    This decorator raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") when applied to a non-protocol class.

    Note

    `runtime_checkable()` will check only the presence of the required
    methods or attributes, not their type signatures or types.
    For example, [`ssl.SSLObject`](ssl.html#ssl.SSLObject "ssl.SSLObject")
    is a class, therefore it passes an [`issubclass()`](functions.html#issubclass "issubclass")
    check against [Callable](#annotating-callables). However, the
    `ssl.SSLObject.__init__` method exists only to raise a
    [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") with a more informative message, therefore making
    it impossible to call (instantiate) `ssl.SSLObject`.

    Note

    An [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") check against a runtime-checkable protocol can be
    surprisingly slow compared to an `isinstance()` check against
    a non-protocol class. Consider using alternative idioms such as
    [`hasattr()`](functions.html#hasattr "hasattr") calls for structural checks in performance-sensitive
    code.

    Added in version 3.8.

    Changed in version 3.12: The internal implementation of [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") checks against
    runtime-checkable protocols now uses [`inspect.getattr_static()`](inspect.html#inspect.getattr_static "inspect.getattr_static")
    to look up attributes (previously, [`hasattr()`](functions.html#hasattr "hasattr") was used).
    As a result, some objects which used to be considered instances
    of a runtime-checkable protocol may no longer be considered instances
    of that protocol on Python 3.12+, and vice versa.
    Most users are unlikely to be affected by this change.

    Changed in version 3.12: The members of a runtime-checkable protocol are now considered “frozen”
    at runtime as soon as the class has been created. Monkey-patching
    attributes onto a runtime-checkable protocol will still work, but will
    have no impact on [`isinstance()`](functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") checks comparing objects to the
    protocol. See [What’s new in Python 3.12](../whatsnew/3.12.html#whatsnew-typing-py312)
    for more details.

*class*typing.TypedDict(*dict*)
:   Special construct to add type hints to a dictionary.
    At runtime “`TypedDict` instances” are simply [`dicts`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict").

    `TypedDict` declares a dictionary type that expects all of its
    instances to have a certain set of keys, where each key is
    associated with a value of a consistent type. This expectation
    is not checked at runtime but is only enforced by type checkers.
    Usage:

    ```
    classPoint2D(TypedDict):
        x: int
        y: int
        label: str

    a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
    b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check

    assert Point2D(x=1, y=2, label='first') == dict(x=1, y=2, label='first')
    ```

    An alternative way to create a `TypedDict` is by using
    function-call syntax. The second argument must be a literal [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict"):

    ```
    Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': str})
    ```

    This functional syntax allows defining keys which are not valid
    [identifiers](../reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers), for example because they are
    keywords or contain hyphens, or when key names must not be
    [mangled](../reference/expressions.html#private-name-mangling) like regular private names:

    ```
    # raises SyntaxError
    classPoint2D(TypedDict):
        in: int  # 'in' is a keyword
        x-y: int  # name with hyphens

    classDefinition(TypedDict):
        __schema: str  # mangled to `_Definition__schema`

    # OK, functional syntax
    Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'in': int, 'x-y': int})
    Definition = TypedDict('Definition', {'__schema': str})  # not mangled
    ```

    By default, all keys must be present in a `TypedDict`. It is possible to
    mark individual keys as non-required using [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired "typing.NotRequired"):

    ```
    classPoint2D(TypedDict):
        x: int
        y: int
        label: NotRequired[str]

    # Alternative syntax
    Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': NotRequired[str]})
    ```

    This means that a `Point2D` `TypedDict` can have the `label`
    key omitted.

    It is also possible to mark all keys as non-required by default
    by specifying a totality of `False`:

    ```
    classPoint2D(TypedDict, total=False):
        x: int
        y: int

    # Alternative syntax
    Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int}, total=False)
    ```

    This means that a `Point2D` `TypedDict` can have any of the keys
    omitted. A type checker is only expected to support a literal `False` or
    `True` as the value of the `total` argument. `True` is the default,
    and makes all items defined in the class body required.

    Individual keys of a `total=False` `TypedDict` can be marked as
    required using [`Required`](#typing.Required "typing.Required"):

    ```
    classPoint2D(TypedDict, total=False):
        x: Required[int]
        y: Required[int]
        label: str

    # Alternative syntax
    Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {
        'x': Required[int],
        'y': Required[int],
        'label': str
    }, total=False)
    ```

    It is possible for a `TypedDict` type to inherit from one or more other `TypedDict` types
    using the class-based syntax.
    Usage:

    ```
    classPoint3D(Point2D):
        z: int
    ```

    `Point3D` has three items: `x`, `y` and `z`. It is equivalent to this
    definition:

    ```
    classPoint3D(TypedDict):
        x: int
        y: int
        z: int
    ```

    A `TypedDict` cannot inherit from a non-`TypedDict` class,
    except for [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic"). For example:

    ```
    classX(TypedDict):
        x: int

    classY(TypedDict):
        y: int

    classZ(object): pass  # A non-TypedDict class

    classXY(X, Y): pass  # OK

    classXZ(X, Z): pass  # raises TypeError
    ```

    A `TypedDict` can be generic:

    ```
    classGroup[T](TypedDict):
        key: T
        group: list[T]
    ```

    To create a generic `TypedDict` that is compatible with Python 3.11
    or lower, inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") explicitly:

    ```
    T = TypeVar("T")

    classGroup(TypedDict, Generic[T]):
        key: T
        group: list[T]
    ```

    A `TypedDict` can be introspected via annotations dicts
    (see [Annotations Best Practices](../howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto) for more information on annotations best practices),
    [`__total__`](#typing.TypedDict.__total__ "typing.TypedDict.__total__"), [`__required_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__ "typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__"), and [`__optional_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__ "typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__").

    \_\_total\_\_
    :   `Point2D.__total__` gives the value of the `total` argument.
        Example:

        ```
        >>> fromtypingimport TypedDict
        >>> classPoint2D(TypedDict): pass
        >>> Point2D.__total__
        True
        >>> classPoint2D(TypedDict, total=False): pass
        >>> Point2D.__total__
        False
        >>> classPoint3D(Point2D): pass
        >>> Point3D.__total__
        True
        ```

        This attribute reflects *only* the value of the `total` argument
        to the current `TypedDict` class, not whether the class is semantically
        total. For example, a `TypedDict` with `__total__` set to `True` may
        have keys marked with [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired "typing.NotRequired"), or it may inherit from another
        `TypedDict` with `total=False`. Therefore, it is generally better to use
        [`__required_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__ "typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__") and [`__optional_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__ "typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__") for introspection.

    \_\_required\_keys\_\_
    :   Added in version 3.9.

    \_\_optional\_keys\_\_
    :   `Point2D.__required_keys__` and `Point2D.__optional_keys__` return
        [`frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset") objects containing required and non-required keys, respectively.

        Keys marked with [`Required`](#typing.Required "typing.Required") will always appear in `__required_keys__`
        and keys marked with [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired "typing.NotRequired") will always appear in `__optional_keys__`.

        For backwards compatibility with Python 3.10 and below,
        it is also possible to use inheritance to declare both required and
        non-required keys in the same `TypedDict` . This is done by declaring a
        `TypedDict` with one value for the `total` argument and then
        inheriting from it in another `TypedDict` with a different value for
        `total`:

        ```
        >>> classPoint2D(TypedDict, total=False):
        ...     x: int
        ...     y: int
        ...
        >>> classPoint3D(Point2D):
        ...     z: int
        ...
        >>> Point3D.        True
        >>> Point3D.        True
        ```

        Added in version 3.9.

        Note

        If `from __future__ import annotations` is used or if annotations
        are given as strings, annotations are not evaluated when the
        `TypedDict` is defined. Therefore, the runtime introspection that
        `__required_keys__` and `__optional_keys__` rely on may not work
        properly, and the values of the attributes may be incorrect.

    Support for [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly "typing.ReadOnly") is reflected in the following attributes:

    \_\_readonly\_keys\_\_
    :   A [`frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset") containing the names of all read-only keys. Keys
        are read-only if they carry the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly "typing.ReadOnly") qualifier.

        Added in version 3.13.

    \_\_mutable\_keys\_\_
    :   A [`frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset") containing the names of all mutable keys. Keys
        are mutable if they do not carry the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly "typing.ReadOnly") qualifier.

        Added in version 3.13.

    See the [TypedDict](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/typeddict.html#typeddict) section in the typing documentation for more examples and detailed rules.

    Added in version 3.8.

    Changed in version 3.9: `TypedDict` is now a function rather than a class.
    It can still be used as a class base, as described above.

    Changed in version 3.11: Added support for marking individual keys as [`Required`](#typing.Required "typing.Required") or [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired "typing.NotRequired").
    See [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/).

    Changed in version 3.11: Added support for generic `TypedDict`s.

    Changed in version 3.13: Removed support for the keyword-argument method of creating `TypedDict`s.

    Changed in version 3.13: Support for the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly "typing.ReadOnly") qualifier was added.

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: When using the functional syntax to create a TypedDict class, failing to
    pass a value to the ‘fields’ parameter (`TD = TypedDict("TD")`) is
    deprecated. Passing `None` to the ‘fields’ parameter
    (`TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`) is also deprecated. Both will be
    disallowed in Python 3.15. To create a TypedDict class with 0 fields,
    use `class TD(TypedDict): pass` or `TD = TypedDict("TD", {})`.

### Functions and decorators

typing.cast(*typ*, *val*)
:   Cast a value to a type.

    This returns the value unchanged. To the type checker this
    signals that the return value has the designated type, but at
    runtime we intentionally don’t check anything (we want this
    to be as fast as possible).

typing.assert\_type(*val*, *typ*, */*)
:   Ask a static type checker to confirm that *val* has an inferred type of *typ*.

    At runtime this does nothing: it returns the first argument unchanged with no
    checks or side effects, no matter the actual type of the argument.

    When a static type checker encounters a call to `assert_type()`, it
    emits an error if the value is not of the specified type:

    ```
    defgreet(name: str) -> None:
        assert_type(name, str)  # OK, inferred type of `name` is `str`
        assert_type(name, int)  # type checker error
    ```

    This function is useful for ensuring the type checker’s understanding of a
    script is in line with the developer’s intentions:

    ```
    defcomplex_function(arg: object):
        # Do some complex type-narrowing logic,
        # after which we hope the inferred type will be `int`
        ...
        # Test whether the type checker correctly understands our function
        assert_type(arg, int)
    ```

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.assert\_never(*arg*, */*)
:   Ask a static type checker to confirm that a line of code is unreachable.

    Example:

    ```
    defint_or_str(arg: int | str) -> None:
        match arg:
            case int():
                print("It's an int")
            case str():
                print("It's a str")
            case_ as unreachable:
                assert_never(unreachable)
    ```

    Here, the annotations allow the type checker to infer that the
    last case can never execute, because `arg` is either
    an [`int`](functions.html#int "int") or a [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"), and both options are covered by
    earlier cases.

    If a type checker finds that a call to `assert_never()` is
    reachable, it will emit an error. For example, if the type annotation
    for `arg` was instead `int | str | float`, the type checker would
    emit an error pointing out that `unreachable` is of type [`float`](functions.html#float "float").
    For a call to `assert_never` to pass type checking, the inferred type of
    the argument passed in must be the bottom type, [`Never`](#typing.Never "typing.Never"), and nothing
    else.

    At runtime, this throws an exception when called.

    See also

    [Unreachable Code and Exhaustiveness Checking](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/guides/unreachable.html) has more
    information about exhaustiveness checking with static typing.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.reveal\_type(*obj*, */*)
:   Ask a static type checker to reveal the inferred type of an expression.

    When a static type checker encounters a call to this function,
    it emits a diagnostic with the inferred type of the argument. For example:

    ```
    x: int = 1
    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is "builtins.int"
    ```

    This can be useful when you want to debug how your type checker
    handles a particular piece of code.

    At runtime, this function prints the runtime type of its argument to
    [`sys.stderr`](sys.html#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") and returns the argument unchanged (allowing the call to
    be used within an expression):

    ```
    x = reveal_type(1)  # prints "Runtime type is int"
    print(x)  # prints "1"
    ```

    Note that the runtime type may be different from (more or less specific
    than) the type statically inferred by a type checker.

    Most type checkers support `reveal_type()` anywhere, even if the
    name is not imported from `typing`. Importing the name from
    `typing`, however, allows your code to run without runtime errors and
    communicates intent more clearly.

    Added in version 3.11.

@typing.dataclass\_transform(*\**, *eq\_default=True*, *order\_default=False*, *kw\_only\_default=False*, *frozen\_default=False*, *field\_specifiers=()*, *\*\*kwargs*)
:   Decorator to mark an object as providing
    [`dataclass`](dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass "dataclasses.dataclass")-like behavior.

    `dataclass_transform` may be used to
    decorate a class, metaclass, or a function that is itself a decorator.
    The presence of `@dataclass_transform()` tells a static type checker that the
    decorated object performs runtime “magic” that
    transforms a class in a similar way to
    [`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass "dataclasses.dataclass").

    Example usage with a decorator function:

    ```
    @dataclass_transform()
    defcreate_model[T](cls: type[T]) -> type[T]:
        ...
        return cls

    @create_model
    classCustomerModel:
        id: int
        name: str
    ```

    On a base class:

    ```
    @dataclass_transform()
    classModelBase: ...

    classCustomerModel(ModelBase):
        id: int
        name: str
    ```

    On a metaclass:

    ```
    @dataclass_transform()
    classModelMeta(type): ...

    classModelBase(metaclass=ModelMeta): ...

    classCustomerModel(ModelBase):
        id: int
        name: str
    ```

    The `CustomerModel` classes defined above will
    be treated by type checkers similarly to classes created with
    [`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass "dataclasses.dataclass").
    For example, type checkers will assume these classes have
    `__init__` methods that accept `id` and `name`.

    The decorated class, metaclass, or function may accept the following bool
    arguments which type checkers will assume have the same effect as they
    would have on the
    [`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass "dataclasses.dataclass") decorator: `init`,
    `eq`, `order`, `unsafe_hash`, `frozen`, `match_args`,
    `kw_only`, and `slots`. It must be possible for the value of these
    arguments (`True` or `False`) to be statically evaluated.

    The arguments to the `dataclass_transform` decorator can be used to
    customize the default behaviors of the decorated class, metaclass, or
    function:

    Parameters:
    :   * **eq\_default** ([*bool*](functions.html#bool "bool")) – Indicates whether the `eq` parameter is assumed to be
          `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
          Defaults to `True`.
        * **order\_default** ([*bool*](functions.html#bool "bool")) – Indicates whether the `order` parameter is
          assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
          Defaults to `False`.
        * **kw\_only\_default** ([*bool*](functions.html#bool "bool")) – Indicates whether the `kw_only` parameter is
          assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
          Defaults to `False`.
        * **frozen\_default** ([*bool*](functions.html#bool "bool")) –

          Indicates whether the `frozen` parameter is
          assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
          Defaults to `False`.

          Added in version 3.12.
        * **field\_specifiers** ([*tuple*](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")*[*[*Callable*](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Callable "collections.abc.Callable")*[**...**,* *Any**]**,* *...**]*) – Specifies a static list of supported classes
          or functions that describe fields, similar to [`dataclasses.field()`](dataclasses.html#dataclasses.field "dataclasses.field").
          Defaults to `()`.
        * **\*\*kwargs** (*Any*) – Arbitrary other keyword arguments are accepted in order to allow for
          possible future extensions.

    Type checkers recognize the following optional parameters on field
    specifiers:

    **Recognised parameters for field specifiers**

    | Parameter name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `init` | Indicates whether the field should be included in the synthesized `__init__` method. If unspecified, `init` defaults to `True`. |
    | `default` | Provides the default value for the field. |
    | `default_factory` | Provides a runtime callback that returns the default value for the field. If neither `default` nor `default_factory` are specified, the field is assumed to have no default value and must be provided a value when the class is instantiated. |
    | `factory` | An alias for the `default_factory` parameter on field specifiers. |
    | `kw_only` | Indicates whether the field should be marked as keyword-only. If `True`, the field will be keyword-only. If `False`, it will not be keyword-only. If unspecified, the value of the `kw_only` parameter on the object decorated with `dataclass_transform` will be used, or if that is unspecified, the value of `kw_only_default` on `dataclass_transform` will be used. |
    | `alias` | Provides an alternative name for the field. This alternative name is used in the synthesized `__init__` method. |

    At runtime, this decorator records its arguments in the
    `__dataclass_transform__` attribute on the decorated object.
    It has no other runtime effect.

    See [**PEP 681**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.11.

@typing.overload
:   Decorator for creating overloaded functions and methods.

    The `@overload` decorator allows describing functions and methods
    that support multiple different combinations of argument types. A series
    of `@overload`-decorated definitions must be followed by exactly one
    non-`@overload`-decorated definition (for the same function/method).

    `@overload`-decorated definitions are for the benefit of the
    type checker only, since they will be overwritten by the
    non-`@overload`-decorated definition. The non-`@overload`-decorated
    definition, meanwhile, will be used at
    runtime but should be ignored by a type checker. At runtime, calling
    an `@overload`-decorated function directly will raise
    [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError").

    An example of overload that gives a more
    precise type than can be expressed using a union or a type variable:

    ```
    @overload
    defprocess(response: None) -> None:
        ...
    @overload
    defprocess(response: int) -> tuple[int, str]:
        ...
    @overload
    defprocess(response: bytes) -> str:
        ...
    defprocess(response):
        ...  # actual implementation goes here
    ```

    See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more details and comparison with other typing semantics.

    Changed in version 3.11: Overloaded functions can now be introspected at runtime using
    [`get_overloads()`](#typing.get_overloads "typing.get_overloads").

typing.get\_overloads(*func*)
:   Return a sequence of [`@overload`](#typing.overload "typing.overload")-decorated definitions for
    *func*.

    *func* is the function object for the implementation of the
    overloaded function. For example, given the definition of `process` in
    the documentation for [`@overload`](#typing.overload "typing.overload"),
    `get_overloads(process)` will return a sequence of three function objects
    for the three defined overloads. If called on a function with no overloads,
    `get_overloads()` returns an empty sequence.

    `get_overloads()` can be used for introspecting an overloaded function at
    runtime.

    Added in version 3.11.

typing.clear\_overloads()
:   Clear all registered overloads in the internal registry.

    This can be used to reclaim the memory used by the registry.

    Added in version 3.11.

@typing.final
:   Decorator to indicate final methods and final classes.

    Decorating a method with `@final` indicates to a type checker that the
    method cannot be overridden in a subclass. Decorating a class with `@final`
    indicates that it cannot be subclassed.

    For example:

    ```
    classBase:
        @final
        defdone(self) -> None:
            ...
    classSub(Base):
        defdone(self) -> None:  # Error reported by type checker
            ...

    @final
    classLeaf:
        ...
    classOther(Leaf):  # Error reported by type checker
        ...
    ```

    There is no runtime checking of these properties. See [**PEP 591**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0591/) for
    more details.

    Added in version 3.8.

    Changed in version 3.11: The decorator will now attempt to set a `__final__` attribute to `True`
    on the decorated object. Thus, a check like
    `if getattr(obj, "__final__", False)` can be used at runtime
    to determine whether an object `obj` has been marked as final.
    If the decorated object does not support setting attributes,
    the decorator returns the object unchanged without raising an exception.

@typing.no\_type\_check
:   Decorator to indicate that annotations are not type hints.

    This works as a class or function [decorator](../glossary.html#term-decorator). With a class, it
    applies recursively to all methods and classes defined in that class
    (but not to methods defined in its superclasses or subclasses). Type
    checkers will ignore all annotations in a function or class with this
    decorator.

    `@no_type_check` mutates the decorated object in place.

@typing.no\_type\_check\_decorator
:   Decorator to give another decorator the [`no_type_check()`](#typing.no_type_check "typing.no_type_check") effect.

    This wraps the decorator with something that wraps the decorated
    function in [`no_type_check()`](#typing.no_type_check "typing.no_type_check").

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: No type checker ever added support for `@no_type_check_decorator`. It
    is therefore deprecated, and will be removed in Python 3.15.

@typing.override
:   Decorator to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a
    method or attribute in a superclass.

    Type checkers should emit an error if a method decorated with `@override`
    does not, in fact, override anything.
    This helps prevent bugs that may occur when a base class is changed without
    an equivalent change to a child class.

    For example:

    ```
    classBase:
        deflog_status(self) -> None:
            ...

    classSub(Base):
        @override
        deflog_status(self) -> None:  # Okay: overrides Base.log_status
            ...

        @override
        defdone(self) -> None:  # Error reported by type checker
            ...
    ```

    There is no runtime checking of this property.

    The decorator will attempt to set an `__override__` attribute to `True` on
    the decorated object. Thus, a check like
    `if getattr(obj, "__override__", False)` can be used at runtime to determine
    whether an object `obj` has been marked as an override. If the decorated object
    does not support setting attributes, the decorator returns the object unchanged
    without raising an exception.

    See [**PEP 698**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/) for more details.

    Added in version 3.12.

@typing.type\_check\_only
:   Decorator to mark a class or function as unavailable at runtime.

    This decorator is itself not available at runtime. It is mainly
    intended to mark classes that are defined in type stub files if
    an implementation returns an instance of a private class:

    ```
    @type_check_only
    classResponse:  # private or not available at runtime
        code: int
        defget_header(self, name: str) -> str: ...

    deffetch_response() -> Response: ...
    ```

    Note that returning instances of private classes is not recommended.
    It is usually preferable to make such classes public.

### Introspection helpers

typing.get\_type\_hints(*obj*, *globalns=None*, *localns=None*, *include\_extras=False*)
:   Return a dictionary containing type hints for a function, method, module,
    class object, or other callable object.

    This is often the same as `obj.__annotations__`, but this function makes
    the following changes to the annotations dictionary:

    * Forward references encoded as string literals or [`ForwardRef`](#typing.ForwardRef "typing.ForwardRef")
      objects are handled by evaluating them in *globalns*, *localns*, and
      (where applicable) *obj*’s [type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) namespace.
      If *globalns* or *localns* is not given, appropriate namespace
      dictionaries are inferred from *obj*.
    * `None` is replaced with [`types.NoneType`](types.html#types.NoneType "types.NoneType").
    * If [`@no_type_check`](#typing.no_type_check "typing.no_type_check") has been applied to *obj*, an
      empty dictionary is returned.
    * If *obj* is a class `C`, the function returns a dictionary that merges
      annotations from `C`’s base classes with those on `C` directly. This
      is done by traversing [`C.__mro__`](../reference/datamodel.html#type.__mro__ "type.__mro__") and iteratively
      combining
      `__annotations__` dictionaries. Annotations on classes appearing
      earlier in the [method resolution order](../glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) always take precedence over
      annotations on classes appearing later in the method resolution order.
    * The function recursively replaces all occurrences of
      `Annotated[T, ...]`, `Required[T]`, `NotRequired[T]`, and `ReadOnly[T]`
      with `T`, unless *include\_extras* is set to `True` (see
      [`Annotated`](#typing.Annotated "typing.Annotated") for more information).

    See also [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations"), a lower-level function that
    returns annotations more directly.

    Caution

    This function may execute arbitrary code contained in annotations.
    See [Security implications of introspecting annotations](annotationlib.html#annotationlib-security) for more information.

    Note

    If any forward references in the annotations of *obj* are not resolvable
    or are not valid Python code, this function will raise an exception
    such as [`NameError`](exceptions.html#NameError "NameError"). For example, this can happen with imported
    [type aliases](#type-aliases) that include forward references,
    or with names imported under [`if TYPE_CHECKING`](#typing.TYPE_CHECKING "typing.TYPE_CHECKING").

    Note

    Calling `get_type_hints()` on an instance is not supported.
    To retrieve annotations for an instance, call
    `get_type_hints()` on the instance’s class instead
    (for example, `get_type_hints(type(obj))`).

    Changed in version 3.9: Added `include_extras` parameter as part of [**PEP 593**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0593/).
    See the documentation on [`Annotated`](#typing.Annotated "typing.Annotated") for more information.

    Changed in version 3.11: Previously, `Optional[t]` was added for function and method annotations
    if a default value equal to `None` was set.
    Now the annotation is returned unchanged.

    Changed in version 3.14: Calling `get_type_hints()` on instances is no longer supported.
    Some instances were accepted in earlier versions as an undocumented
    implementation detail.

typing.get\_origin(*tp*)
:   Get the unsubscripted version of a type: for a typing object of the form
    `X[Y, Z, ...]` return `X`.

    If `X` is a typing-module alias for a builtin or
    [`collections`](collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") class, it will be normalized to the original class.
    If `X` is an instance of [`ParamSpecArgs`](#typing.ParamSpecArgs "typing.ParamSpecArgs") or [`ParamSpecKwargs`](#typing.ParamSpecKwargs "typing.ParamSpecKwargs"),
    return the underlying [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec "typing.ParamSpec").
    Return `None` for unsupported objects.

    Examples:

    ```
    assert get_origin(str) is None
    assert get_origin(Dict[str, int]) is dict
    assert get_origin(Union[int, str]) is Union
    assert get_origin(Annotated[str, "metadata"]) is Annotated
    P = ParamSpec('P')
    assert get_origin(P.args) is P
    assert get_origin(P.kwargs) is P
    ```

    Added in version 3.8.

typing.get\_args(*tp*)
:   Get type arguments with all substitutions performed: for a typing object
    of the form `X[Y, Z, ...]` return `(Y, Z, ...)`.

    If `X` is a union or [`Literal`](#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") contained in another
    generic type, the order of `(Y, Z, ...)` may be different from the order
    of the original arguments `[Y, Z, ...]` due to type caching.
    Return `()` for unsupported objects.

    Examples:

    ```
    assert get_args(int) == ()
    assert get_args(Dict[int, str]) == (int, str)
    assert get_args(Union[int, str]) == (int, str)
    ```

    Added in version 3.8.

typing.get\_protocol\_members(*tp*)
:   Return the set of members defined in a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol").

    ```
    >>> fromtypingimport Protocol, get_protocol_members
    >>> classP(Protocol):
    ...     defa(self) -> str: ...
    ...     b: int
    >>> get_protocol_members(P) == frozenset({'a', 'b'})
    True
    ```

    Raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") for arguments that are not Protocols.

    Added in version 3.13.

typing.is\_protocol(*tp*)
:   Determine if a type is a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol").

    For example:

    ```
    classP(Protocol):
        defa(self) -> str: ...
        b: int

    is_protocol(P)    # => True
    is_protocol(int)  # => False
    ```

    Added in version 3.13.

typing.is\_typeddict(*tp*)
:   Check if a type is a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict").

    For example:

    ```
    classFilm(TypedDict):
        title: str
        year: int

    assert is_typeddict(Film)
    assert not is_typeddict(list | str)

    # TypedDict is a factory for creating typed dicts,
    # not a typed dict itself
    assert not is_typeddict(TypedDict)
    ```

    Added in version 3.10.

*class*typing.ForwardRef
:   Class used for internal typing representation of string forward references.

    For example, `List["SomeClass"]` is implicitly transformed into
    `List[ForwardRef("SomeClass")]`. `ForwardRef` should not be instantiated by
    a user, but may be used by introspection tools.

    Note

    [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) generic types such as `list["SomeClass"]` will not be
    implicitly transformed into `list[ForwardRef("SomeClass")]` and thus
    will not automatically resolve to `list[SomeClass]`.

    Added in version 3.7.4.

    Changed in version 3.14: This is now an alias for [`annotationlib.ForwardRef`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.ForwardRef "annotationlib.ForwardRef"). Several undocumented
    behaviors of this class have been changed; for example, after a `ForwardRef` has
    been evaluated, the evaluated value is no longer cached.

typing.evaluate\_forward\_ref(*forward\_ref*, *\**, *owner=None*, *globals=None*, *locals=None*, *type\_params=None*, *format=annotationlib.Format.VALUE*)
:   Evaluate an [`annotationlib.ForwardRef`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.ForwardRef "annotationlib.ForwardRef") as a [type hint](../glossary.html#term-type-hint).

    This is similar to calling [`annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate "annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate"),
    but unlike that method, `evaluate_forward_ref()` also
    recursively evaluates forward references nested within the type hint.

    See the documentation for [`annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate "annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate") for
    the meaning of the *owner*, *globals*, *locals*, *type\_params*, and *format* parameters.

    Caution

    This function may execute arbitrary code contained in annotations.
    See [Security implications of introspecting annotations](annotationlib.html#annotationlib-security) for more information.

    Added in version 3.14.

typing.NoDefault
:   A sentinel object used to indicate that a type parameter has no default
    value. For example:

    ```
    >>> T = TypeVar("T")
    >>> T.__default__ is typing.NoDefault
    True
    >>> S = TypeVar("S", default=None)
    >>> S.__default__ is None
    True
    ```

    Added in version 3.13.

### Constant

typing.TYPE\_CHECKING
:   A special constant that is assumed to be `True` by 3rd party static
    type checkers. It’s `False` at runtime.

    A module which is expensive to import, and which only contain types
    used for typing annotations, can be safely imported inside an
    `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block. This prevents the module from actually
    being imported at runtime; annotations aren’t eagerly evaluated
    (see [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/)) so using undefined symbols in annotations is
    harmless–as long as you don’t later examine them.
    Your static type analysis tool will set `TYPE_CHECKING` to
    `True` during static type analysis, which means the module will
    be imported and the types will be checked properly during such analysis.

    Usage:

    ```
    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        importexpensive_mod

    deffun(arg: expensive_mod.SomeType) -> None:
        local_var: expensive_mod.AnotherType = other_fun()
    ```

    If you occasionally need to examine type annotations at runtime
    which may contain undefined symbols, use
    [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") with a `format` parameter
    of [`annotationlib.Format.STRING`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.STRING "annotationlib.Format.STRING") or
    [`annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF`](annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF "annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF") to safely retrieve the
    annotations without raising [`NameError`](exceptions.html#NameError "NameError").

    Added in version 3.5.2.

### Deprecated aliases

This module defines several deprecated aliases to pre-existing
standard library classes. These were originally included in the `typing`
module in order to support parameterizing these generic classes using `[]`.
However, the aliases became redundant in Python 3.9 when the
corresponding pre-existing classes were enhanced to support `[]` (see
[**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/)).

The redundant types are deprecated as of Python 3.9. However, while the aliases
may be removed at some point, removal of these aliases is not currently
planned. As such, no deprecation warnings are currently issued by the
interpreter for these aliases.

If at some point it is decided to remove these deprecated aliases, a
deprecation warning will be issued by the interpreter for at least two releases
prior to removal. The aliases are guaranteed to remain in the `typing` module
without deprecation warnings until at least Python 3.14.

Type checkers are encouraged to flag uses of the deprecated types if the
program they are checking targets a minimum Python version of 3.9 or newer.

#### Aliases to built-in types

*class*typing.Dict(*dict, MutableMapping[KT, VT]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict").

    Note that to annotate arguments, it is preferred
    to use an abstract collection type such as [`Mapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping "collections.abc.Mapping")
    rather than to use [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict") or `typing.Dict`.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.List(*list, MutableSequence[T]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list").

    Note that to annotate arguments, it is preferred
    to use an abstract collection type such as
    [`Sequence`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence "collections.abc.Sequence") or [`Iterable`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterable "collections.abc.Iterable")
    rather than to use [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list") or `typing.List`.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.list`](stdtypes.html#list "list") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Set(*set, MutableSet[T]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`builtins.set`](stdtypes.html#set "set").

    Note that to annotate arguments, it is preferred
    to use an abstract collection type such as [`collections.abc.Set`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Set "collections.abc.Set")
    rather than to use [`set`](stdtypes.html#set "set") or [`typing.Set`](#typing.Set "typing.Set").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.set`](stdtypes.html#set "set") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.FrozenSet(*frozenset, AbstractSet[T\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`builtins.frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset")
    now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

typing.Tuple
:   Deprecated alias for [`tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple").

    [`tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") and `Tuple` are special-cased in the type system; see
    [Annotating tuples](#annotating-tuples) for more details.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Type(*Generic[CT\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`type`](functions.html#type "type").

    See [The type of class objects](#type-of-class-objects) for details on using [`type`](functions.html#type "type") or
    `typing.Type` in type annotations.

    Added in version 3.5.2.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`builtins.type`](functions.html#type "type") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

#### Aliases to types in [`collections`](collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes")

*class*typing.DefaultDict(*collections.defaultdict, MutableMapping[KT, VT]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.defaultdict`](collections.html#collections.defaultdict "collections.defaultdict").

    Added in version 3.5.2.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.defaultdict`](collections.html#collections.defaultdict "collections.defaultdict") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.OrderedDict(*collections.OrderedDict, MutableMapping[KT, VT]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.OrderedDict`](collections.html#collections.OrderedDict "collections.OrderedDict").

    Added in version 3.7.2.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.OrderedDict`](collections.html#collections.OrderedDict "collections.OrderedDict") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.ChainMap(*collections.ChainMap, MutableMapping[KT, VT]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.ChainMap`](collections.html#collections.ChainMap "collections.ChainMap").

    Added in version 3.6.1.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.ChainMap`](collections.html#collections.ChainMap "collections.ChainMap") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Counter(*collections.Counter, Dict[T, int]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.Counter`](collections.html#collections.Counter "collections.Counter").

    Added in version 3.6.1.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.Counter`](collections.html#collections.Counter "collections.Counter") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Deque(*deque, MutableSequence[T]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.deque`](collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque").

    Added in version 3.6.1.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.deque`](collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

#### Aliases to other concrete types

*class*typing.Pattern

*class*typing.Match
:   Deprecated aliases corresponding to the return types from
    [`re.compile()`](re.html#re.compile "re.compile") and [`re.match()`](re.html#re.match "re.match").

    These types (and the corresponding functions) are generic over
    [`AnyStr`](#typing.AnyStr "typing.AnyStr"). `Pattern` can be specialised as `Pattern[str]` or
    `Pattern[bytes]`; `Match` can be specialised as `Match[str]` or
    `Match[bytes]`.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: Classes `Pattern` and `Match` from [`re`](re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") now support `[]`.
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Text
:   Deprecated alias for [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str").

    `Text` is provided to supply a forward
    compatible path for Python 2 code: in Python 2, `Text` is an alias for
    `unicode`.

    Use `Text` to indicate that a value must contain a unicode string in
    a manner that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3:

    ```
    defadd_unicode_checkmark(text: Text) -> Text:
        return text + u' \u2713'
    ```

    Added in version 3.5.2.

    Deprecated since version 3.11: Python 2 is no longer supported, and most type checkers also no longer
    support type checking Python 2 code. Removal of the alias is not
    currently planned, but users are encouraged to use
    [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str") instead of `Text`.

#### Aliases to container ABCs in [`collections.abc`](collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers")

*class*typing.AbstractSet(*Collection[T\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.Set`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Set "collections.abc.Set").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.Set`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Set "collections.abc.Set") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.ByteString(*Sequence[int]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.ByteString`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ByteString "collections.abc.ByteString").

    Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
    implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use in
    type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union
    that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
    `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

    `ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that
    would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").
    However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an
    instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
    about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") were
    also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at runtime
    or by static type checkers).

    See [**PEP 688**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/#current-options) for more details.

    Deprecated since version 3.9, will be removed in version 3.17.

*class*typing.Collection(*Sized, Iterable[T\_co], Container[T\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.Collection`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Collection "collections.abc.Collection").

    Added in version 3.6.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.Collection`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Collection "collections.abc.Collection") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Container(*Generic[T\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.Container`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Container "collections.abc.Container").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.Container`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Container "collections.abc.Container") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.ItemsView(*MappingView, AbstractSet[tuple[KT\_co, VT\_co]]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.ItemsView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ItemsView "collections.abc.ItemsView").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.ItemsView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ItemsView "collections.abc.ItemsView") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.KeysView(*MappingView, AbstractSet[KT\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.KeysView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.KeysView "collections.abc.KeysView").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.KeysView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.KeysView "collections.abc.KeysView") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.Mapping(*Collection[KT], Generic[KT, VT\_co]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.Mapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping "collections.abc.Mapping").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.Mapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping "collections.abc.Mapping") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.MappingView(*Sized*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.MappingView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MappingView "collections.abc.MappingView").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.MappingView`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MappingView "collections.abc.MappingView") now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).

*class*typing.MutableMapping(*Mapping[KT, VT]*)
:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.MutableMapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableMapping "collections.abc.MutableMapping").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.MutableMapping`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableMapping "collections.abc.MutableMapping")
    now supports subscripting (`[]`).

:   Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.MutableSequence`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableSequence "collections.abc.MutableSequence").

    Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.MutableSequence`](collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableSequence "collections.abc.MutableSequence")
    now supports subscripting (`[]`).
    See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.html#types-genericalias).
