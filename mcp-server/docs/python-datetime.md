# Python datetime — Date and Time Types


---

## 1. `datetime` — Basic date and time types

**Source code:** [Lib/datetime.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/datetime.py)

---

The `datetime` module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is
on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

## Aware and naive objects

Date and time objects may be categorized as “aware” or “naive” depending on
whether or not they include time zone information.

With sufficient knowledge of applicable algorithmic and political time
adjustments, such as time zone and daylight saving time information,
an **aware** object can locate itself relative to other aware objects.
An aware object represents a specific moment in time that is not open to
interpretation. [[1]](#id4)

A **naive** object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate
itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other time zone is
purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a
particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to
understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality.

For applications requiring aware objects, [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") and [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time")
objects have an optional time zone information attribute, `tzinfo`, that
can be set to an instance of a subclass of the abstract `tzinfo` class.
These [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") objects capture information about the offset from UTC
time, the time zone name, and whether daylight saving time is in effect.

Only one concrete [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") class, the [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") class, is
supplied by the `datetime` module. The `timezone` class can
represent simple time zones with fixed offsets from UTC, such as UTC itself or
North American EST and EDT time zones. Supporting time zones at deeper levels of
detail is up to the application. The rules for time adjustment across the
world are more political than rational, change frequently, and there is no
standard suitable for every application aside from UTC.

## Constants

The `datetime` module exports the following constants:

datetime.MINYEAR
:   The smallest year number allowed in a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") or [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object.
    [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") is 1.

datetime.MAXYEAR
:   The largest year number allowed in a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") or [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object.
    [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR") is 9999.

datetime.UTC
:   Alias for the UTC time zone singleton [`datetime.timezone.utc`](#datetime.timezone.utc "datetime.timezone.utc").

    Added in version 3.11.

## Available types

*class*datetime.date
:   An idealized naive date, assuming the current Gregorian calendar always was, and
    always will be, in effect. Attributes: [`year`](#datetime.date.year "datetime.date.year"), [`month`](#datetime.date.month "datetime.date.month"), and
    [`day`](#datetime.date.day "datetime.date.day").

*class*datetime.time
:   An idealized time, independent of any particular day, assuming that every day
    has exactly 24\*60\*60 seconds. (There is no notion of “leap seconds” here.)
    Attributes: [`hour`](#datetime.time.hour "datetime.time.hour"), [`minute`](#datetime.time.minute "datetime.time.minute"), [`second`](#datetime.time.second "datetime.time.second"), [`microsecond`](#datetime.time.microsecond "datetime.time.microsecond"),
    and [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo").

*class*datetime.datetime
:   A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: [`year`](#datetime.datetime.year "datetime.datetime.year"), [`month`](#datetime.datetime.month "datetime.datetime.month"),
    [`day`](#datetime.datetime.day "datetime.datetime.day"), [`hour`](#datetime.datetime.hour "datetime.datetime.hour"), [`minute`](#datetime.datetime.minute "datetime.datetime.minute"), [`second`](#datetime.datetime.second "datetime.datetime.second"), [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond"),
    and [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo").

*class*datetime.timedelta
:   A duration expressing the difference between two [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime")
    or [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") instances to microsecond resolution.

*class*datetime.tzinfo
:   An abstract base class for time zone information objects. These are used by the
    [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") and [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") classes to provide a customizable notion of
    time adjustment (for example, to account for time zone and/or daylight saving
    time).

*class*datetime.timezone
:   A class that implements the [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") abstract base class as a
    fixed offset from the UTC.

    Added in version 3.2.

Objects of these types are immutable.

Subclass relationships:

### Common properties

The [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date"), [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime"), [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time"), and [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") types
share these common features:

* Objects of these types are immutable.
* Objects of these types are [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable), meaning that they can be used as
  dictionary keys.
* Objects of these types support efficient pickling via the [`pickle`](pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") module.

### Determining if an object is aware or naive

Objects of the [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") type are always naive.

An object of type [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") or [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") may be aware or naive.

A [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object `d` is aware if both of the following hold:

1. `d.tzinfo` is not `None`
2. `d.tzinfo.utcoffset(d)` does not return `None`

Otherwise, `d` is naive.

A [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object `t` is aware if both of the following hold:

1. `t.tzinfo` is not `None`
2. `t.tzinfo.utcoffset(None)` does not return `None`.

Otherwise, `t` is naive.

The distinction between aware and naive doesn’t apply to [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta")
objects.

## `timedelta` objects

A [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object represents a duration, the difference between two
[`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") or [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") instances.

*class*datetime.timedelta(*days=0*, *seconds=0*, *microseconds=0*, *milliseconds=0*, *minutes=0*, *hours=0*, *weeks=0*)
:   All arguments are optional and default to 0. Arguments may be integers
    or floats, and may be positive or negative.

    Only *days*, *seconds* and *microseconds* are stored internally.
    Arguments are converted to those units:

    * A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds.
    * A minute is converted to 60 seconds.
    * An hour is converted to 3600 seconds.
    * A week is converted to 7 days.

    and days, seconds and microseconds are then normalized so that the
    representation is unique, with

    * `0 <= microseconds < 1000000`
    * `0 <= seconds < 3600*24` (the number of seconds in one day)
    * `-999999999 <= days <= 999999999`

    The following example illustrates how any arguments besides
    *days*, *seconds* and *microseconds* are “merged” and normalized into those
    three resulting attributes:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> delta = dt.timedelta(
    ...     days=50,
    ...     seconds=27,
    ...     microseconds=10,
    ...     milliseconds=29000,
    ...     minutes=5,
    ...     hours=8,
    ...     weeks=2
    ... )
    >>> # Only days, seconds, and microseconds remain
    >>> delta
    datetime.timedelta(days=64, seconds=29156, microseconds=10)
    ```

    Tip

    `import datetime as dt` instead of `import datetime` or
    `from datetime import datetime` to avoid confusion between the module
    and the class. See [How I Import Python’s datetime Module](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/09/12/how-i-import-pythons-datetime-module/).

    If any argument is a float and there are fractional microseconds,
    the fractional microseconds left over from all arguments are
    combined and their sum is rounded to the nearest microsecond using
    round-half-to-even tiebreaker. If no argument is a float, the
    conversion and normalization processes are exact (no information is
    lost).

    If the normalized value of days lies outside the indicated range,
    [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") is raised.

    Note that normalization of negative values may be surprising at first. For
    example:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> d = dt.timedelta(microseconds=-1)
    >>> (d.days, d.seconds, d.microseconds)
    (-1, 86399, 999999)
    ```

    Since the string representation of `timedelta` objects can be confusing,
    use the following recipe to produce a more readable format:

    ```
    >>> defpretty_timedelta(td):
    ...     if td.days >= 0:
    ...         return str(td)
    ...     return f'-({-td!s})'
    ...
    >>> d = timedelta(hours=-1)
    >>> str(d)  # not human-friendly
    '-1 day, 23:00:00'
    >>> pretty_timedelta(d)
    '-(1:00:00)'
    ```

Class attributes:

timedelta.min
:   The most negative [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object, `timedelta(-999999999)`.

timedelta.max
:   The most positive [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object, `timedelta(days=999999999,
    hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59, microseconds=999999)`.

timedelta.resolution
:   The smallest possible difference between non-equal [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") objects,
    `timedelta(microseconds=1)`.

Note that, because of normalization, `timedelta.max` is greater than `-timedelta.min`.
`-timedelta.max` is not representable as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object.

Instance attributes (read-only):

timedelta.days
:   Between -999,999,999 and 999,999,999 inclusive.

timedelta.seconds
:   Between 0 and 86,399 inclusive.

    Caution

    It is a somewhat common bug for code to unintentionally use this attribute
    when it is actually intended to get a [`total_seconds()`](#datetime.timedelta.total_seconds "datetime.timedelta.total_seconds")
    value instead:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> duration = dt.timedelta(seconds=11235813)
    >>> duration.days, duration.seconds
    (130, 3813)
    >>> duration.total_seconds()
    11235813.0
    ```

timedelta.microseconds
:   Between 0 and 999,999 inclusive.

Supported operations:

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `t1 = t2 + t3` | Sum of `t2` and `t3`. Afterwards `t1 - t2 == t3` and `t1 - t3 == t2` are true. (1) |
| `t1 = t2 - t3` | Difference of `t2` and `t3`. Afterwards `t1 == t2 - t3` and `t2 == t1 + t3` are true. (1)(6) |
| `t1 = t2 * i or t1 = i * t2` | Delta multiplied by an integer. Afterwards `t1 // i == t2` is true, provided `i != 0`. |
|  | In general, `t1  * i == t1 * (i-1) + t1` is true. (1) |
| `t1 = t2 * f or t1 = f * t2` | Delta multiplied by a float. The result is rounded to the nearest multiple of timedelta.resolution using round-half-to-even. |
| `f = t2 / t3` | Division (3) of overall duration `t2` by interval unit `t3`. Returns a [`float`](functions.html#float "float") object. |
| `t1 = t2 / f or t1 = t2 / i` | Delta divided by a float or an int. The result is rounded to the nearest multiple of timedelta.resolution using round-half-to-even. |
| `t1 = t2 // i` or `t1 = t2 // t3` | The floor is computed and the remainder (if any) is thrown away. In the second case, an integer is returned. (3) |
| `t1 = t2 % t3` | The remainder is computed as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object. (3) |
| `q, r = divmod(t1, t2)` | Computes the quotient and the remainder: `q = t1 // t2` (3) and `r = t1 % t2`. `q` is an integer and `r` is a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object. |
| `+t1` | Returns a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object with the same value. (2) |
| `-t1` | Equivalent to `timedelta(-t1.days, -t1.seconds, -t1.microseconds)`, and to `t1 * -1`. (1)(4) |
| `abs(t)` | Equivalent to `+t` when `t.days >= 0`, and to `-t` when `t.days < 0`. (2) |
| `str(t)` | Returns a string in the form `[D day[s], ][H]H:MM:SS[.UUUUUU]`, where D is negative for negative `t`. (5) |
| `repr(t)` | Returns a string representation of the [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object as a constructor call with canonical attribute values. |

Notes:

1. This is exact but may overflow.
2. This is exact and cannot overflow.
3. Division by zero raises [`ZeroDivisionError`](exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError").
4. `-timedelta.max` is not representable as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object.
5. String representations of [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") objects are normalized
   similarly to their internal representation. This leads to somewhat
   unusual results for negative timedeltas. For example:

   ```
   >>> timedelta(hours=-5)
   datetime.timedelta(days=-1, seconds=68400)
   >>> print(_)
   -1 day, 19:00:00
   ```
6. The expression `t2 - t3` will always be equal to the expression `t2 + (-t3)` except
   when t3 is equal to `timedelta.max`; in that case the former will produce a result
   while the latter will overflow.

In addition to the operations listed above, [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") objects support
certain additions and subtractions with [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") and [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime")
objects (see below).

Changed in version 3.2: Floor division and true division of a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object by another
`timedelta` object are now supported, as are remainder operations and
the [`divmod()`](functions.html#divmod "divmod") function. True division and multiplication of a
`timedelta` object by a [`float`](functions.html#float "float") object are now supported.

[`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") objects support equality and order comparisons.

In Boolean contexts, a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object is
considered to be true if and only if it isn’t equal to `timedelta(0)`.

Instance methods:

timedelta.total\_seconds()
:   Return the total number of seconds contained in the duration. Equivalent to
    `td / timedelta(seconds=1)`. For interval units other than seconds, use the
    division form directly (for example, `td / timedelta(microseconds=1)`).

    Note that for very large time intervals (greater than 270 years on
    most platforms) this method will lose microsecond accuracy.

    Added in version 3.2.

### Examples of usage: `timedelta`

An additional example of normalization:

```
>>> # Components of another_year add up to exactly 365 days
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> year = dt.timedelta(days=365)
>>> another_year = dt.timedelta(weeks=40, days=84, hours=23,
...                             minutes=50, seconds=600)
>>> year == another_year
True
>>> year.total_seconds()
31536000.0
```

Examples of [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") arithmetic:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> year = dt.timedelta(days=365)
>>> ten_years = 10 * year
>>> ten_years
datetime.timedelta(days=3650)
>>> ten_years.days // 365
10
>>> nine_years = ten_years - year
>>> nine_years
datetime.timedelta(days=3285)
>>> three_years = nine_years // 3
>>> three_years, three_years.days // 365
(datetime.timedelta(days=1095), 3)
```

## `date` objects

A [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object represents a date (year, month and day) in an idealized
calendar, the current Gregorian calendar indefinitely extended in both
directions.

January 1 of year 1 is called day number 1, January 2 of year 1 is
called day number 2, and so on. [[2]](#id5)

*class*datetime.date(*year*, *month*, *day*)
:   All arguments are required. Arguments must be integers, in the following
    ranges:

    * `MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR`
    * `1 <= month <= 12`
    * `1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year`

    If an argument outside those ranges is given, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

Other constructors, all class methods:

*classmethod*date.today()
:   Return the current local date.

    This is equivalent to `date.fromtimestamp(time.time())`.

*classmethod*date.fromtimestamp(*timestamp*)
:   Return the local date corresponding to the POSIX *timestamp*, such as is
    returned by [`time.time()`](time.html#time.time "time.time").

    This may raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError"), if the timestamp is out
    of the range of values supported by the platform C `localtime()`
    function, and [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") on `localtime()` failure.
    It’s common for this to be restricted to years from 1970 through 2038. Note
    that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds in their notion of a
    timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by `fromtimestamp()`.

    Changed in version 3.3: Raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") instead of [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the timestamp
    is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
    `localtime()` function. Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") instead of
    `ValueError` on `localtime()` failure.

*classmethod*date.fromordinal(*ordinal*)
:   Return the date corresponding to the proleptic Gregorian *ordinal*, where
    January 1 of year 1 has ordinal 1.

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised unless `1 <= ordinal <=
    date.max.toordinal()`. For any date `d`,
    `date.fromordinal(d.toordinal()) == d`.

*classmethod*date.fromisoformat(*date\_string*)
:   Return a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") corresponding to a *date\_string* given in any valid
    ISO 8601 format, with the following exceptions:

    1. Reduced precision dates are not currently supported (`YYYY-MM`,
       `YYYY`).
    2. Extended date representations are not currently supported
       (`±YYYYYY-MM-DD`).
    3. Ordinal dates are not currently supported (`YYYY-OOO`).

    Examples:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.date.fromisoformat('2019-12-04')
    datetime.date(2019, 12, 4)
    >>> dt.date.fromisoformat('20191204')
    datetime.date(2019, 12, 4)
    >>> dt.date.fromisoformat('2021-W01-1')
    datetime.date(2021, 1, 4)
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.11: Previously, this method only supported the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

*classmethod*date.fromisocalendar(*year*, *week*, *day*)
:   Return a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") corresponding to the ISO calendar date specified by
    *year*, *week* and *day*. This is the inverse of the function [`date.isocalendar()`](#datetime.date.isocalendar "datetime.date.isocalendar").

    Added in version 3.8.

*classmethod*date.strptime(*date\_string*, *format*)
:   Return a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") corresponding to *date\_string*, parsed according to
    *format*. This is equivalent to:

    ```
    date(*(time.strptime(date_string, format)[0:3]))
    ```

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the date\_string and format
    can’t be parsed by [`time.strptime()`](time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") or if it returns a value which isn’t a
    time tuple. See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and
    [`date.fromisoformat()`](#datetime.date.fromisoformat "datetime.date.fromisoformat").

    Note

    If *format* specifies a day of month without a year a
    [`DeprecationWarning`](exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") is emitted. This is to avoid a quadrennial
    leap year bug in code seeking to parse only a month and day as the
    default year used in absence of one in the format is not a leap year.
    Such *format* values may raise an error as of Python 3.15. The
    workaround is to always include a year in your *format*. If parsing
    *date\_string* values that do not have a year, explicitly add a year that
    is a leap year before parsing:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> date_string = "02/29"
    >>> when = dt.date.strptime(f"{date_string};1984", "%m/%d;%Y")  # Avoids leap year bug.
    >>> when.strftime("%B %d")
    'February 29'
    ```

    Added in version 3.14.

Class attributes:

date.min
:   The earliest representable date, `date(MINYEAR, 1, 1)`.

date.max
:   The latest representable date, `date(MAXYEAR, 12, 31)`.

date.resolution
:   The smallest possible difference between non-equal date objects,
    `timedelta(days=1)`.

Instance attributes (read-only):

date.year
:   Between [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") and [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR") inclusive.

date.month
:   Between 1 and 12 inclusive.

date.day
:   Between 1 and the number of days in the given month of the given year.

Supported operations:

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `date2 = date1 + timedelta` | `date2` will be `timedelta.days` days after `date1`. (1) |
| `date2 = date1 - timedelta` | Computes `date2` such that `date2 + timedelta == date1`. (2) |
| `timedelta = date1 - date2` | (3) |
| `date1 == date2`  `date1 != date2` | Equality comparison. (4) |
| `date1 < date2`  `date1 > date2`  `date1 <= date2`  `date1 >= date2` | Order comparison. (5) |

Notes:

1. *date2* is moved forward in time if `timedelta.days > 0`, or backward if
   `timedelta.days < 0`. Afterward `date2 - date1 == timedelta.days`.
   `timedelta.seconds` and `timedelta.microseconds` are ignored.
   [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") is raised if `date2.year` would be smaller than
   [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") or larger than [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR").
2. `timedelta.seconds` and `timedelta.microseconds` are ignored.
3. This is exact, and cannot overflow. `timedelta.seconds` and
   `timedelta.microseconds` are 0, and `date2 + timedelta == date1` after.
4. [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") objects are equal if they represent the same date.

   `date` objects that are not also [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances
   are never equal to `datetime` objects, even if they represent
   the same date.
5. *date1* is considered less than *date2* when *date1* precedes *date2* in time.
   In other words, `date1 < date2` if and only if `date1.toordinal() <
   date2.toordinal()`.

   Order comparison between a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object that is not also a
   [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instance and a `datetime` object raises
   [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

Changed in version 3.13: Comparison between [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object and an instance of
the [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") subclass that is not a `datetime` subclass
no longer converts the latter to `date`, ignoring the time part
and the time zone.
The default behavior can be changed by overriding the special comparison
methods in subclasses.

In Boolean contexts, all [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") objects are considered to be true.

Instance methods:

date.replace(*year=self.year*, *month=self.month*, *day=self.day*)
:   Return a new [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object with the same values, but with specified
    parameters updated.

    Example:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> d = dt.date(2002, 12, 31)
    >>> d.replace(day=26)
    datetime.date(2002, 12, 26)
    ```

    The generic function [`copy.replace()`](copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace") also supports [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date")
    objects.

date.timetuple()
:   Return a [`time.struct_time`](time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") such as returned by [`time.localtime()`](time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime").

    The hours, minutes and seconds are 0, and the DST flag is -1.

    `d.timetuple()` is equivalent to:

    ```
    time.struct_time((d.year, d.month, d.day, 0, 0, 0, d.weekday(), yday, -1))
    ```

    where `yday = d.toordinal() - date(d.year, 1, 1).toordinal() + 1`
    is the day number within the current year starting with 1 for January 1st.

date.toordinal()
:   Return the proleptic Gregorian ordinal of the date, where January 1 of year 1
    has ordinal 1. For any [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object `d`,
    `date.fromordinal(d.toordinal()) == d`.

date.weekday()
:   Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
    For example, `date(2002, 12, 4).weekday() == 2`, a Wednesday. See also
    [`isoweekday()`](#datetime.date.isoweekday "datetime.date.isoweekday").

date.isoweekday()
:   Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.
    For example, `date(2002, 12, 4).isoweekday() == 3`, a Wednesday. See also
    [`weekday()`](#datetime.date.weekday "datetime.date.weekday"), [`isocalendar()`](#datetime.date.isocalendar "datetime.date.isocalendar").

date.isocalendar()
:   Return a [named tuple](../glossary.html#term-named-tuple) object with three components: `year`,
    `week` and `weekday`.

    The ISO calendar is a widely used variant of the Gregorian calendar. [[3]](#id6)

    The ISO year consists of 52 or 53 full weeks, and where a week starts on a
    Monday and ends on a Sunday. The first week of an ISO year is the first
    (Gregorian) calendar week of a year containing a Thursday. This is called week
    number 1, and the ISO year of that Thursday is the same as its Gregorian year.

    For example, 2004 begins on a Thursday, so the first week of ISO year 2004
    begins on Monday, 29 Dec 2003 and ends on Sunday, 4 Jan 2004:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.date(2003, 12, 29).isocalendar()
    datetime.IsoCalendarDate(year=2004, week=1, weekday=1)
    >>> dt.date(2004, 1, 4).isocalendar()
    datetime.IsoCalendarDate(year=2004, week=1, weekday=7)
    ```

    Changed in version 3.9: Result changed from a tuple to a [named tuple](../glossary.html#term-named-tuple).

date.isoformat()
:   Return a string representing the date in ISO 8601 format, `YYYY-MM-DD`:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.date(2002, 12, 4).isoformat()
    '2002-12-04'
    ```

date.\_\_str\_\_()
:   For a date `d`, `str(d)` is equivalent to `d.isoformat()`.

date.ctime()
:   Return a string representing the date:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.date(2002, 12, 4).ctime()
    'Wed Dec  4 00:00:00 2002'
    ```

    `d.ctime()` is equivalent to:

    ```
    time.ctime(time.mktime(d.timetuple()))
    ```

    on platforms where the native C
    `ctime()` function (which [`time.ctime()`](time.html#time.ctime "time.ctime") invokes, but which
    `date.ctime()` does not invoke) conforms to the C standard.

date.strftime(*format*)
:   Return a string representing the date, controlled by an explicit format string.
    Format codes referring to hours, minutes or seconds will see 0 values.
    See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`date.isoformat()`](#datetime.date.isoformat "datetime.date.isoformat").

date.\_\_format\_\_(*format*)
:   Same as [`date.strftime()`](#datetime.date.strftime "datetime.date.strftime"). This makes it possible to specify a format
    string for a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object in [formatted string
    literals](../reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) and when using [`str.format()`](stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format").
    See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`date.isoformat()`](#datetime.date.isoformat "datetime.date.isoformat").

### Examples of usage: `date`

Example of counting days to an event:

```
>>> importtime
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> today = dt.date.today()
>>> today
datetime.date(2007, 12, 5)
>>> today == dt.date.fromtimestamp(time.time())
True
>>> my_birthday = dt.date(today.year, 6, 24)
>>> if my_birthday < today:
...     my_birthday = my_birthday.replace(year=today.year + 1)
...
>>> my_birthday
datetime.date(2008, 6, 24)
>>> time_to_birthday = abs(my_birthday - today)
>>> time_to_birthday.days
202
```

More examples of working with [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date"):

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> d = dt.date.fromordinal(730920) # 730920th day after 1. 1. 0001
>>> d
datetime.date(2002, 3, 11)

>>> # Methods related to formatting string output
>>> d.isoformat()
'2002-03-11'
>>> d.strftime("%d/%m/%y")
'11/03/02'
>>> d.strftime("%A %d. %B %Y")
'Monday 11. March 2002'
>>> d.ctime()
'Mon Mar 11 00:00:00 2002'
>>> 'The {1} is {0:%d}, the {2} is {0:%B}.'.format(d, "day", "month")
'The day is 11, the month is March.'

>>> # Methods for extracting 'components' under different calendars
>>> t = d.timetuple()
>>> for i in t:
...     print(i)
2002                # year
3                   # month
11                  # day
0
0
0
0                   # weekday (0 = Monday)
70                  # 70th day in the year
-1
>>> ic = d.isocalendar()
>>> for i in ic:
...     print(i)
2002                # ISO year
11                  # ISO week number
1                   # ISO day number ( 1 = Monday )

>>> # A date object is immutable; all operations produce a new object
>>> d.replace(year=2005)
datetime.date(2005, 3, 11)
```

## `datetime` objects

A [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object is a single object containing all the information
from a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object and a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object.

Like a [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object, [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") assumes the current Gregorian
calendar extended in both directions; like a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object,
`datetime` assumes there are exactly 3600\*24 seconds in every day.

Constructor:

*class*datetime.datetime(*year*, *month*, *day*, *hour=0*, *minute=0*, *second=0*, *microsecond=0*, *tzinfo=None*, *\**, *fold=0*)
:   The *year*, *month* and *day* arguments are required. *tzinfo* may be `None`, or an
    instance of a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass. The remaining arguments must be integers
    in the following ranges:

    * `MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR`,
    * `1 <= month <= 12`,
    * `1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year`,
    * `0 <= hour < 24`,
    * `0 <= minute < 60`,
    * `0 <= second < 60`,
    * `0 <= microsecond < 1000000`,
    * `fold in [0, 1]`.

    If an argument outside those ranges is given, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *fold* parameter.

Other constructors, all class methods:

*classmethod*datetime.today()
:   Return the current local date and time, with [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") `None`.

    Equivalent to:

    ```
    datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())
    ```

    See also [`now()`](#datetime.datetime.now "datetime.datetime.now"), [`fromtimestamp()`](#datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp").

    This method is functionally equivalent to [`now()`](#datetime.datetime.now "datetime.datetime.now"), but without a
    `tz` parameter.

*classmethod*datetime.now(*tz=None*)
:   Return the current local date and time.

    If optional argument *tz* is `None`
    or not specified, this is like [`today()`](#datetime.datetime.today "datetime.datetime.today"), but, if possible, supplies more
    precision than can be gotten from going through a [`time.time()`](time.html#time.time "time.time") timestamp
    (for example, this may be possible on platforms supplying the C
    `gettimeofday()` function).

    If *tz* is not `None`, it must be an instance of a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass,
    and the current date and time are converted to *tz*’s time zone.

    This function is preferred over [`today()`](#datetime.datetime.today "datetime.datetime.today") and [`utcnow()`](#datetime.datetime.utcnow "datetime.datetime.utcnow").

    Note

    Subsequent calls to `datetime.now()` may return the same
    instant depending on the precision of the underlying clock.

*classmethod*datetime.utcnow()
:   Return the current UTC date and time, with [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") `None`.

    This is like [`now()`](#datetime.datetime.now "datetime.datetime.now"), but returns the current UTC date and time, as a naive
    [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object. An aware current UTC datetime can be obtained by
    calling `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. See also `now()`.

    Warning

    Because naive `datetime` objects are treated by many `datetime` methods
    as local times, it is preferred to use aware datetimes to represent times
    in UTC. As such, the recommended way to create an object representing the
    current time in UTC is by calling `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.

    Deprecated since version 3.12: Use [`datetime.now()`](#datetime.datetime.now "datetime.datetime.now") with [`UTC`](#datetime.UTC "datetime.UTC") instead.

*classmethod*datetime.fromtimestamp(*timestamp*, *tz=None*)
:   Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, such as is
    returned by [`time.time()`](time.html#time.time "time.time"). If optional argument *tz* is `None` or not
    specified, the timestamp is converted to the platform’s local date and time, and
    the returned [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object is naive.

    If *tz* is not `None`, it must be an instance of a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass, and the
    timestamp is converted to *tz*’s time zone.

    `fromtimestamp()` may raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError"), if the timestamp is out of
    the range of values supported by the platform C `localtime()` or
    `gmtime()` functions, and [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") on `localtime()` or
    `gmtime()` failure.
    It’s common for this to be restricted to years in
    1970 through 2038. Note that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds in
    their notion of a timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by `fromtimestamp()`,
    and then it’s possible to have two timestamps differing by a second that yield
    identical [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects. This method is preferred over
    [`utcfromtimestamp()`](#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp").

    Changed in version 3.3: Raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") instead of [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the timestamp
    is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
    `localtime()` or `gmtime()` functions. Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError")
    instead of `ValueError` on `localtime()` or `gmtime()`
    failure.

    Changed in version 3.6: `fromtimestamp()` may return instances with [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") set to 1.

*classmethod*datetime.utcfromtimestamp(*timestamp*)
:   Return the UTC [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, with
    [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") `None`. (The resulting object is naive.)

    This may raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError"), if the timestamp is
    out of the range of values supported by the platform C `gmtime()` function,
    and [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") on `gmtime()` failure.
    It’s common for this to be restricted to years in 1970 through 2038.

    To get an aware [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object, call [`fromtimestamp()`](#datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp"):

    ```
    datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, timezone.utc)
    ```

    On the POSIX compliant platforms, it is equivalent to the following
    expression:

    ```
    datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc) + timedelta(seconds=timestamp)
    ```

    except the latter formula always supports the full years range: between
    [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") and [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR") inclusive.

    Warning

    Because naive `datetime` objects are treated by many `datetime` methods
    as local times, it is preferred to use aware datetimes to represent times
    in UTC. As such, the recommended way to create an object representing a
    specific timestamp in UTC is by calling
    `datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=timezone.utc)`.

    Changed in version 3.3: Raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") instead of [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the timestamp
    is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
    `gmtime()` function. Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") instead of
    `ValueError` on `gmtime()` failure.

    Changed in version 3.15: Accepts any real number as *timestamp*, not only integer or float.

    Deprecated since version 3.12: Use [`datetime.fromtimestamp()`](#datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp") with [`UTC`](#datetime.UTC "datetime.UTC") instead.

*classmethod*datetime.fromordinal(*ordinal*)
:   Return the [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") corresponding to the proleptic Gregorian ordinal,
    where January 1 of year 1 has ordinal 1. [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised unless
    `1 <= ordinal <= datetime.max.toordinal()`. The hour, minute, second and
    microsecond of the result are all 0, and [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None`.

*classmethod*datetime.combine(*date*, *time*, *tzinfo=time.tzinfo*)
:   Return a new [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object whose date components are equal to the
    given [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object’s, and whose time components
    are equal to the given [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object’s. If the *tzinfo*
    argument is provided, its value is used to set the [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attribute
    of the result, otherwise the [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo") attribute of the *time* argument
    is used. If the *date* argument is a `datetime` object, its time components
    and `tzinfo` attributes are ignored.

    For any [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object `d`,
    `d == datetime.combine(d.date(), d.time(), d.tzinfo)`.

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *tzinfo* argument.

*classmethod*datetime.fromisoformat(*date\_string*)
:   Return a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") corresponding to a *date\_string* in any valid
    ISO 8601 format, with the following exceptions:

    1. Time zone offsets may have fractional seconds.
    2. The `T` separator may be replaced by any single unicode character.
    3. Fractional hours and minutes are not supported.
    4. Reduced precision dates are not currently supported (`YYYY-MM`,
       `YYYY`).
    5. Extended date representations are not currently supported
       (`±YYYYYY-MM-DD`).
    6. Ordinal dates are not currently supported (`YYYY-OOO`).

    Examples:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 0)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('20111104')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 0)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04T00:05:23')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04T00:05:23Z')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('20111104T000523')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-W01-2T00:05:23.283')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 1, 4, 0, 5, 23, 283000)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04 00:05:23.283')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23, 283000)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04 00:05:23.283+00:00')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23, 283000, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    >>> dt.datetime.fromisoformat('2011-11-04T00:05:23+04:00')
    datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 4, 0, 5, 23,
        tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=14400)))
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.11: Previously, this method only supported formats that could be emitted by
    [`date.isoformat()`](#datetime.date.isoformat "datetime.date.isoformat") or [`datetime.isoformat()`](#datetime.datetime.isoformat "datetime.datetime.isoformat").

*classmethod*datetime.fromisocalendar(*year*, *week*, *day*)
:   Return a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") corresponding to the ISO calendar date specified
    by *year*, *week* and *day*. The non-date components of the datetime are populated
    with their normal default values. This is the inverse of the function
    [`datetime.isocalendar()`](#datetime.datetime.isocalendar "datetime.datetime.isocalendar").

    Added in version 3.8.

*classmethod*datetime.strptime(*date\_string*, *format*)
:   Return a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") corresponding to *date\_string*, parsed according to
    *format*.

    If *format* does not contain microseconds or time zone information, this is equivalent to:

    ```
    datetime(*(time.strptime(date_string, format)[0:6]))
    ```

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the date\_string and format
    can’t be parsed by [`time.strptime()`](time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") or if it returns a value which isn’t a
    time tuple. See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and
    [`datetime.fromisoformat()`](#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat "datetime.datetime.fromisoformat").

    Changed in version 3.13: If *format* specifies a day of month without a year a
    [`DeprecationWarning`](exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") is now emitted. This is to avoid a quadrennial
    leap year bug in code seeking to parse only a month and day as the
    default year used in absence of one in the format is not a leap year.
    Such *format* values may raise an error as of Python 3.15. The
    workaround is to always include a year in your *format*. If parsing
    *date\_string* values that do not have a year, explicitly add a year that
    is a leap year before parsing:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> date_string = "02/29"
    >>> when = dt.datetime.strptime(f"{date_string};1984", "%m/%d;%Y")  # Avoids leap year bug.
    >>> when.strftime("%B %d")
    'February 29'
    ```

Class attributes:

datetime.min
:   The earliest representable [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime"), `datetime(MINYEAR, 1, 1,
    tzinfo=None)`.

datetime.max
:   The latest representable [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime"), `datetime(MAXYEAR, 12, 31, 23, 59,
    59, 999999, tzinfo=None)`.

datetime.resolution
:   The smallest possible difference between non-equal [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects,
    `timedelta(microseconds=1)`.

Instance attributes (read-only):

datetime.year
:   Between [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") and [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR") inclusive.

datetime.month
:   Between 1 and 12 inclusive.

datetime.day
:   Between 1 and the number of days in the given month of the given year.

datetime.hour
:   In `range(24)`.

datetime.minute
:   In `range(60)`.

datetime.second
:   In `range(60)`.

datetime.microsecond
:   In `range(1000000)`.

datetime.tzinfo
:   The object passed as the *tzinfo* argument to the [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") constructor,
    or `None` if none was passed.

datetime.fold
:   In `[0, 1]`. Used to disambiguate wall times during a repeated interval. (A
    repeated interval occurs when clocks are rolled back at the end of daylight saving
    time or when the UTC offset for the current zone is decreased for political reasons.)
    The values 0 and 1 represent, respectively, the earlier and later of the two
    moments with the same wall time representation.

    Added in version 3.6.

Supported operations:

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `datetime2 = datetime1 + timedelta` | (1) |
| `datetime2 = datetime1 - timedelta` | (2) |
| `timedelta = datetime1 - datetime2` | (3) |
| `datetime1 == datetime2`  `datetime1 != datetime2` | Equality comparison. (4) |
| `datetime1 < datetime2`  `datetime1 > datetime2`  `datetime1 <= datetime2`  `datetime1 >= datetime2` | Order comparison. (5) |

1. `datetime2` is a duration of `timedelta` removed from `datetime1`, moving forward in
   time if `timedelta.days > 0`, or backward if `timedelta.days < 0`. The
   result has the same [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attribute as the input datetime, and
   `datetime2 - datetime1 == timedelta` after. [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") is raised if
   `datetime2.year` would be smaller than [`MINYEAR`](#datetime.MINYEAR "datetime.MINYEAR") or larger than
   [`MAXYEAR`](#datetime.MAXYEAR "datetime.MAXYEAR"). Note that no time zone adjustments are done even if the
   input is an aware object.
2. Computes the `datetime2` such that `datetime2 + timedelta == datetime1`. As for
   addition, the result has the same [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attribute as the input
   datetime, and no time zone adjustments are done even if the input is aware.
3. Subtraction of a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") from a `datetime` is defined only if
   both operands are naive, or if both are aware. If one is aware and the other is
   naive, [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.

   If both are naive, or both are aware and have the same [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attribute,
   the `tzinfo` attributes are ignored, and the result is a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta")
   object `t` such that `datetime2 + t == datetime1`. No time zone adjustments
   are done in this case.

   If both are aware and have different [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attributes, `a-b` acts
   as if `a` and `b` were first converted to naive UTC datetimes. The
   result is `(a.replace(tzinfo=None) - a.utcoffset()) - (b.replace(tzinfo=None)
   - b.utcoffset())` except that the implementation never overflows.
4. [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects are equal if they represent the same date
   and time, taking into account the time zone.

   Naive and aware [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects are never equal.

   If both comparands are aware, and have the same `tzinfo` attribute,
   the `tzinfo` and [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attributes are ignored and
   the base datetimes are compared.
   If both comparands are aware and have different [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo")
   attributes, the comparison acts as comparands were first converted to UTC
   datetimes except that the implementation never overflows.
   [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances in a repeated interval are never equal to
   `datetime` instances in other time zone.
5. *datetime1* is considered less than *datetime2* when *datetime1* precedes
   *datetime2* in time, taking into account the time zone.

   Order comparison between naive and aware [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects
   raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

   If both comparands are aware, and have the same `tzinfo` attribute,
   the `tzinfo` and [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attributes are ignored and
   the base datetimes are compared.
   If both comparands are aware and have different [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo")
   attributes, the comparison acts as comparands were first converted to UTC
   datetimes except that the implementation never overflows.

Changed in version 3.3: Equality comparisons between aware and naive [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime")
instances don’t raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

Changed in version 3.13: Comparison between [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object and an instance of
the [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") subclass that is not a `datetime` subclass
no longer converts the latter to `date`, ignoring the time part
and the time zone.
The default behavior can be changed by overriding the special comparison
methods in subclasses.

Instance methods:

datetime.date()
:   Return [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") object with same year, month and day.

datetime.time()
:   Return [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object with same hour, minute, second, microsecond and fold.
    [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None`. See also method [`timetz()`](#datetime.datetime.timetz "datetime.datetime.timetz").

    Changed in version 3.6: The fold value is copied to the returned [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object.

datetime.timetz()
:   Return [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object with same hour, minute, second, microsecond, fold, and
    tzinfo attributes. See also method [`time()`](time.html#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.").

    Changed in version 3.6: The fold value is copied to the returned [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object.

datetime.replace(*year=self.year*, *month=self.month*, *day=self.day*, *hour=self.hour*, *minute=self.minute*, *second=self.second*, *microsecond=self.microsecond*, *tzinfo=self.tzinfo*, *\**, *fold=0*)
:   Return a new [`datetime`](#module-datetime "datetime: Basic date and time types.") object with the same attributes, but with
    specified parameters updated. Note that `tzinfo=None` can be specified to
    create a naive datetime from an aware datetime with no conversion of date
    and time data.

    [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects are also supported by generic function
    [`copy.replace()`](copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace").

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *fold* parameter.

datetime.astimezone(*tz=None*)
:   Return a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object with new [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") attribute *tz*,
    adjusting the date and time data so the result is the same UTC time as
    *self*, but in *tz*’s local time.

    If provided, *tz* must be an instance of a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass, and its
    [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.datetime.utcoffset "datetime.datetime.utcoffset") and [`dst()`](#datetime.datetime.dst "datetime.datetime.dst") methods must not return `None`. If *self*
    is naive, it is presumed to represent time in the system time zone.

    If called without arguments (or with `tz=None`) the system local
    time zone is assumed for the target time zone. The `.tzinfo` attribute of the converted
    datetime instance will be set to an instance of [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone")
    with the zone name and offset obtained from the OS.

    If `self.tzinfo` is *tz*, `self.astimezone(tz)` is equal to *self*: no
    adjustment of date or time data is performed. Else the result is local
    time in the time zone *tz*, representing the same UTC time as *self*: after
    `astz = dt.astimezone(tz)`, `astz - astz.utcoffset()` will have
    the same date and time data as `dt - dt.utcoffset()`.

    If you merely want to attach a [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") object *tz* to a datetime *dt* without
    adjustment of date and time data, use `dt.replace(tzinfo=tz)`. If you
    merely want to remove the `timezone` object from an aware datetime *dt* without
    conversion of date and time data, use `dt.replace(tzinfo=None)`.

    Note that the default [`tzinfo.fromutc()`](#datetime.tzinfo.fromutc "datetime.tzinfo.fromutc") method can be overridden in a
    [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass to affect the result returned by `astimezone()`.
    Ignoring error cases, `astimezone()` acts like:

    ```
    defastimezone(self, tz):
        if self.tzinfo is tz:
            return self
        # Convert self to UTC, and attach the new timezone object.
        utc = (self - self.utcoffset()).replace(tzinfo=tz)
        # Convert from UTC to tz's local time.
        return tz.fromutc(utc)
    ```

    Changed in version 3.3: *tz* now can be omitted.

    Changed in version 3.6: The `astimezone()` method can now be called on naive instances that
    are presumed to represent system local time.

datetime.utcoffset()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.utcoffset(self)`, and raises an exception if the latter doesn’t
    return `None` or a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object with magnitude less than one day.

    Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

datetime.dst()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.dst(self)`, and raises an exception if the latter doesn’t return
    `None` or a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object with magnitude less than one day.

    Changed in version 3.7: The DST offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

datetime.tzname()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.tzname(self)`, raises an exception if the latter doesn’t return
    `None` or a string object,

datetime.timetuple()
:   Return a [`time.struct_time`](time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") such as returned by [`time.localtime()`](time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime").

    `d.timetuple()` is equivalent to:

    ```
    time.struct_time((d.year, d.month, d.day,
                      d.hour, d.minute, d.second,
                      d.weekday(), yday, dst))
    ```

    where `yday = d.toordinal() - date(d.year, 1, 1).toordinal() + 1`
    is the day number within the current year starting with 1 for January
    1st. The [`tm_isdst`](time.html#time.struct_time.tm_isdst "time.struct_time.tm_isdst") flag of the result is set according to the
    [`dst()`](#datetime.datetime.dst "datetime.datetime.dst") method: [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo") is `None` or `dst()` returns
    `None`, `tm_isdst` is set to `-1`; else if `dst()` returns a
    non-zero value, `tm_isdst` is set to 1; else `tm_isdst` is
    set to 0.

datetime.utctimetuple()
:   If [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instance `d` is naive, this is the same as
    `d.timetuple()` except that [`tm_isdst`](time.html#time.struct_time.tm_isdst "time.struct_time.tm_isdst") is forced to 0 regardless of what
    `d.dst()` returns. DST is never in effect for a UTC time.

    If `d` is aware, `d` is normalized to UTC time, by subtracting
    `d.utcoffset()`, and a [`time.struct_time`](time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") for the
    normalized time is returned. `tm_isdst` is forced to 0. Note
    that an [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") may be raised if `d.year` was
    `MINYEAR` or `MAXYEAR` and UTC adjustment spills over a year
    boundary.

    Warning

    Because naive `datetime` objects are treated by many `datetime` methods
    as local times, it is preferred to use aware datetimes to represent times
    in UTC; as a result, using `datetime.utctimetuple()` may give misleading
    results. If you have a naive `datetime` representing UTC, use
    `datetime.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)` to make it aware, at which point
    you can use [`datetime.timetuple()`](#datetime.datetime.timetuple "datetime.datetime.timetuple").

datetime.toordinal()
:   Return the proleptic Gregorian ordinal of the date. The same as
    `self.date().toordinal()`.

datetime.timestamp()
:   Return POSIX timestamp corresponding to the [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime")
    instance. The return value is a [`float`](functions.html#float "float") similar to that
    returned by [`time.time()`](time.html#time.time "time.time").

    Naive [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances are assumed to represent local
    time and this method relies on the platform C `mktime()`
    function to perform the conversion. Since `datetime`
    supports wider range of values than `mktime()` on many
    platforms, this method may raise [`OverflowError`](exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") or [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError")
    for times far in the past or far in the future.

    For aware [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances, the return value is computed
    as:

    ```
    (dt - datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)).total_seconds()
    ```

    Note

    There is no method to obtain the POSIX timestamp directly from a
    naive [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instance representing UTC time. If your
    application uses this convention and your system time zone is not
    set to UTC, you can obtain the POSIX timestamp by supplying
    `tzinfo=timezone.utc`:

    ```
    timestamp = dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).timestamp()
    ```

    or by calculating the timestamp directly:

    ```
    timestamp = (dt - datetime(1970, 1, 1)) / timedelta(seconds=1)
    ```

    Added in version 3.3.

    Changed in version 3.6: The `timestamp()` method uses the [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute to
    disambiguate the times during a repeated interval.

datetime.weekday()
:   Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
    The same as `self.date().weekday()`. See also [`isoweekday()`](#datetime.datetime.isoweekday "datetime.datetime.isoweekday").

datetime.isoweekday()
:   Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.
    The same as `self.date().isoweekday()`. See also [`weekday()`](#datetime.datetime.weekday "datetime.datetime.weekday"),
    [`isocalendar()`](#datetime.datetime.isocalendar "datetime.datetime.isocalendar").

datetime.isocalendar()
:   Return a [named tuple](../glossary.html#term-named-tuple) with three components: `year`, `week`
    and `weekday`. The same as `self.date().isocalendar()`.

datetime.isoformat(*sep='T'*, *timespec='auto'*)
:   Return a string representing the date and time in ISO 8601 format:

    * `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond") is not 0
    * `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond") is 0

    If [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.datetime.utcoffset "datetime.datetime.utcoffset") does not return `None`, a string is
    appended, giving the UTC offset:

    * `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond")
      is not 0
    * `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond") is 0

    Examples:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.datetime(2019, 5, 18, 15, 17, 8, 132263).isoformat()
    '2019-05-18T15:17:08.132263'
    >>> dt.datetime(2019, 5, 18, 15, 17, tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc).isoformat()
    '2019-05-18T15:17:00+00:00'
    ```

    The optional argument *sep* (default `'T'`) is a one-character separator,
    placed between the date and time portions of the result. For example:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> classTZ(dt.tzinfo):
    ... """A time zone with an arbitrary, constant -06:39 offset."""
    ...     defutcoffset(self, when):
    ...         return dt.timedelta(hours=-6, minutes=-39)
    ...
    >>> dt.datetime(2002, 12, 25, tzinfo=TZ()).isoformat(' ')
    '2002-12-25 00:00:00-06:39'
    >>> dt.datetime(2009, 11, 27, microsecond=100, tzinfo=TZ()).isoformat()
    '2009-11-27T00:00:00.000100-06:39'
    ```

    The optional argument *timespec* specifies the number of additional
    components of the time to include (the default is `'auto'`).
    It can be one of the following:

    * `'auto'`: Same as `'seconds'` if [`microsecond`](#datetime.datetime.microsecond "datetime.datetime.microsecond") is 0,
      same as `'microseconds'` otherwise.
    * `'hours'`: Include the [`hour`](#datetime.datetime.hour "datetime.datetime.hour") in the two-digit `HH` format.
    * `'minutes'`: Include [`hour`](#datetime.datetime.hour "datetime.datetime.hour") and [`minute`](#datetime.datetime.minute "datetime.datetime.minute") in `HH:MM` format.
    * `'seconds'`: Include [`hour`](#datetime.datetime.hour "datetime.datetime.hour"), [`minute`](#datetime.datetime.minute "datetime.datetime.minute"), and [`second`](#datetime.datetime.second "datetime.datetime.second")
      in `HH:MM:SS` format.
    * `'milliseconds'`: Include full time, but truncate fractional second
      part to milliseconds. `HH:MM:SS.sss` format.
    * `'microseconds'`: Include full time in `HH:MM:SS.ffffff` format.

    Note

    Excluded time components are truncated, not rounded.

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") will be raised on an invalid *timespec* argument:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.datetime.now().isoformat(timespec='minutes')
    '2002-12-25T00:00'
    >>> my_datetime = dt.datetime(2015, 1, 1, 12, 30, 59, 0)
    >>> my_datetime.isoformat(timespec='microseconds')
    '2015-01-01T12:30:59.000000'
    ```

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *timespec* parameter.

datetime.\_\_str\_\_()
:   For a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instance `d`, `str(d)` is equivalent to
    `d.isoformat(' ')`.

datetime.ctime()
:   Return a string representing the date and time:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.datetime(2002, 12, 4, 20, 30, 40).ctime()
    'Wed Dec  4 20:30:40 2002'
    ```

    The output string will *not* include time zone information, regardless
    of whether the input is aware or naive.

    `d.ctime()` is equivalent to:

    ```
    time.ctime(time.mktime(d.timetuple()))
    ```

    on platforms where the native C `ctime()` function
    (which [`time.ctime()`](time.html#time.ctime "time.ctime") invokes, but which
    `datetime.ctime()` does not invoke) conforms to the C standard.

datetime.strftime(*format*)
:   Return a string representing the date and time,
    controlled by an explicit format string.
    See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`datetime.isoformat()`](#datetime.datetime.isoformat "datetime.datetime.isoformat").

datetime.\_\_format\_\_(*format*)
:   Same as [`datetime.strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime"). This makes it possible to specify a format
    string for a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object in [formatted string
    literals](../reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) and when using [`str.format()`](stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format").
    See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`datetime.isoformat()`](#datetime.datetime.isoformat "datetime.datetime.isoformat").

### Examples of usage: `datetime`

Examples of working with [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") objects:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt

>>> # Using datetime.combine()
>>> d = dt.date(2005, 7, 14)
>>> t = dt.time(12, 30)
>>> dt.datetime.combine(d, t)
datetime.datetime(2005, 7, 14, 12, 30)

>>> # Using datetime.now()
>>> dt.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2007, 12, 6, 16, 29, 43, 79043)   # GMT +1
>>> dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc)
datetime.datetime(2007, 12, 6, 15, 29, 43, 79060, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)

>>> # Using datetime.strptime()
>>> my_datetime = dt.datetime.strptime("21/11/06 16:30", "%d/%m/%y %H:%M")
>>> my_datetime
datetime.datetime(2006, 11, 21, 16, 30)

>>> # Using datetime.timetuple() to get tuple of all attributes
>>> tt = my_datetime.timetuple()
>>> for it in tt:
...     print(it)
...
2006    # year
11      # month
21      # day
16      # hour
30      # minute
0       # second
1       # weekday (0 = Monday)
325     # number of days since 1st January
-1      # dst - method tzinfo.dst() returned None

>>> # Date in ISO format
>>> ic = my_datetime.isocalendar()
>>> for it in ic:
...     print(it)
...
2006    # ISO year
47      # ISO week
2       # ISO weekday

>>> # Formatting a datetime
>>> my_datetime.strftime("%A, %d. %B %Y %I:%M%p")
'Tuesday, 21. November 2006 04:30PM'
>>> 'The {1} is {0:%d}, the {2} is {0:%B}, the {3} is {0:%I:%M%p}.'.format(my_datetime, "day", "month", "time")
'The day is 21, the month is November, the time is 04:30PM.'
```

The example below defines a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass capturing time zone
information for Kabul, Afghanistan, which used +4 UTC until 1945
and then +4:30 UTC thereafter:

```
importdatetimeasdt

classKabulTz(dt.tzinfo):
    # Kabul used +4 until 1945, when they moved to +4:30
    UTC_MOVE_DATE = dt.datetime(1944, 12, 31, 20, tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc)

    defutcoffset(self, when):
        if when.year < 1945:
            return dt.timedelta(hours=4)
        elif (1945, 1, 1, 0, 0) <= when.timetuple()[:5] < (1945, 1, 1, 0, 30):
            # An ambiguous ("imaginary") half-hour range representing
            # a 'fold' in time due to the shift from +4 to +4:30.
            # If when falls in the imaginary range, use fold to decide how
            # to resolve. See PEP 495.
            return dt.timedelta(hours=4, minutes=(30 if when.fold else 0))
        else:
            return dt.timedelta(hours=4, minutes=30)

    deffromutc(self, when):
        # Follow same validations as in datetime.tzinfo
        if not isinstance(when, dt.datetime):
            raise TypeError("fromutc() requires a datetime argument")
        if when.tzinfo is not self:
            raise ValueError("when.tzinfo is not self")

        # A custom implementation is required for fromutc as
        # the input to this function is a datetime with utc values
        # but with a tzinfo set to self.
        # See datetime.astimezone or fromtimestamp.
        if when.replace(tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc) >= self.UTC_MOVE_DATE:
            return when + dt.timedelta(hours=4, minutes=30)
        else:
            return when + dt.timedelta(hours=4)

    defdst(self, when):
        # Kabul does not observe daylight saving time.
        return dt.timedelta(0)

    deftzname(self, when):
        if when >= self.UTC_MOVE_DATE:
            return "+04:30"
        return "+04"
```

Usage of `KabulTz` from above:

```
>>> tz1 = KabulTz()

>>> # Datetime before the change
>>> dt1 = dt.datetime(1900, 11, 21, 16, 30, tzinfo=tz1)
>>> print(dt1.utcoffset())
4:00:00

>>> # Datetime after the change
>>> dt2 = dt.datetime(2006, 6, 14, 13, 0, tzinfo=tz1)
>>> print(dt2.utcoffset())
4:30:00

>>> # Convert datetime to another time zone
>>> dt3 = dt2.astimezone(dt.timezone.utc)
>>> dt3
datetime.datetime(2006, 6, 14, 8, 30, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
>>> dt2
datetime.datetime(2006, 6, 14, 13, 0, tzinfo=KabulTz())
>>> dt2 == dt3
True
```

## `time` objects

A [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object represents a (local) time of day, independent of any particular
day, and subject to adjustment via a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") object.

*class*datetime.time(*hour=0*, *minute=0*, *second=0*, *microsecond=0*, *tzinfo=None*, *\**, *fold=0*)
:   All arguments are optional. *tzinfo* may be `None`, or an instance of a
    [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass. The remaining arguments must be integers in the
    following ranges:

    * `0 <= hour < 24`,
    * `0 <= minute < 60`,
    * `0 <= second < 60`,
    * `0 <= microsecond < 1000000`,
    * `fold in [0, 1]`.

    If an argument outside those ranges is given, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised. All
    default to 0 except *tzinfo*, which defaults to `None`.

Class attributes:

time.min
:   The earliest representable [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time"), `time(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

time.max
:   The latest representable [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time"), `time(23, 59, 59, 999999)`.

time.resolution
:   The smallest possible difference between non-equal [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects,
    `timedelta(microseconds=1)`, although note that arithmetic on
    `time` objects is not supported.

Instance attributes (read-only):

time.hour
:   In `range(24)`.

time.minute
:   In `range(60)`.

time.second
:   In `range(60)`.

time.microsecond
:   In `range(1000000)`.

time.tzinfo
:   The object passed as the tzinfo argument to the [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") constructor, or
    `None` if none was passed.

time.fold
:   In `[0, 1]`. Used to disambiguate wall times during a repeated interval. (A
    repeated interval occurs when clocks are rolled back at the end of daylight saving
    time or when the UTC offset for the current zone is decreased for political reasons.)
    The values 0 and 1 represent, respectively, the earlier and later of the two
    moments with the same wall time representation.

    Added in version 3.6.

[`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects support equality and order comparisons,
where `a` is considered less than `b` when `a` precedes `b` in time.

Naive and aware `time` objects are never equal.
Order comparison between naive and aware `time` objects raises
[`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

If both comparands are aware, and have the same [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo")
attribute, the `tzinfo` and `fold` attributes are
ignored and the base times are compared. If both comparands are aware and
have different `tzinfo` attributes, the comparands are first adjusted by
subtracting their UTC offsets (obtained from `self.utcoffset()`).

Changed in version 3.3: Equality comparisons between aware and naive [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") instances
don’t raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

In Boolean contexts, a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object is always considered to be true.

Changed in version 3.5: Before Python 3.5, a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object was considered to be false if it
represented midnight in UTC. This behavior was considered obscure and
error-prone and has been removed in Python 3.5. See [bpo-13936](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13936) for more
information.

Other constructors:

*classmethod*time.fromisoformat(*time\_string*)
:   Return a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") corresponding to a *time\_string* in any valid
    ISO 8601 format, with the following exceptions:

    1. Time zone offsets may have fractional seconds.
    2. The leading `T`, normally required in cases where there may be ambiguity between
       a date and a time, is not required.
    3. Fractional seconds may have any number of digits (anything beyond 6 will
       be truncated).
    4. Fractional hours and minutes are not supported.

    Examples:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('T04:23:01')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('T042301')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01.000384')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1, 384)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01,000384')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1, 384)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01+04:00')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=14400)))
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01Z')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    >>> dt.time.fromisoformat('04:23:01+00:00')
    datetime.time(4, 23, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.11: Previously, this method only supported formats that could be emitted by
    [`time.isoformat()`](#datetime.time.isoformat "datetime.time.isoformat").

*classmethod*time.strptime(*date\_string*, *format*)
:   Return a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") corresponding to *date\_string*, parsed according to
    *format*.

    If *format* does not contain microseconds or timezone information, this is equivalent to:

    ```
    time(*(time.strptime(date_string, format)[3:6]))
    ```

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the *date\_string* and *format*
    cannot be parsed by [`time.strptime()`](time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") or if it returns a value which is not a
    time tuple. See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and
    [`time.fromisoformat()`](#datetime.time.fromisoformat "datetime.time.fromisoformat").

    Added in version 3.14.

Instance methods:

time.replace(*hour=self.hour*, *minute=self.minute*, *second=self.second*, *microsecond=self.microsecond*, *tzinfo=self.tzinfo*, *\**, *fold=0*)
:   Return a new [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") with the same values, but with specified
    parameters updated. Note that `tzinfo=None` can be specified to create a
    naive `time` from an aware `time`, without conversion of the
    time data.

    [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects are also supported by generic function
    [`copy.replace()`](copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace").

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *fold* parameter.

time.isoformat(*timespec='auto'*)
:   Return a string representing the time in ISO 8601 format, one of:

    * `HH:MM:SS.ffffff`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.time.microsecond "datetime.time.microsecond") is not 0
    * `HH:MM:SS`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.time.microsecond "datetime.time.microsecond") is 0
    * `HH:MM:SS.ffffff+HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]`, if [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.time.utcoffset "datetime.time.utcoffset") does not return `None`
    * `HH:MM:SS+HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]`, if [`microsecond`](#datetime.time.microsecond "datetime.time.microsecond") is 0 and [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.time.utcoffset "datetime.time.utcoffset") does not return `None`

    The optional argument *timespec* specifies the number of additional
    components of the time to include (the default is `'auto'`).
    It can be one of the following:

    * `'auto'`: Same as `'seconds'` if [`microsecond`](#datetime.time.microsecond "datetime.time.microsecond") is 0,
      same as `'microseconds'` otherwise.
    * `'hours'`: Include the [`hour`](#datetime.time.hour "datetime.time.hour") in the two-digit `HH` format.
    * `'minutes'`: Include [`hour`](#datetime.time.hour "datetime.time.hour") and [`minute`](#datetime.time.minute "datetime.time.minute") in `HH:MM` format.
    * `'seconds'`: Include [`hour`](#datetime.time.hour "datetime.time.hour"), [`minute`](#datetime.time.minute "datetime.time.minute"), and [`second`](#datetime.time.second "datetime.time.second")
      in `HH:MM:SS` format.
    * `'milliseconds'`: Include full time, but truncate fractional second
      part to milliseconds. `HH:MM:SS.sss` format.
    * `'microseconds'`: Include full time in `HH:MM:SS.ffffff` format.

    Note

    Excluded time components are truncated, not rounded.

    [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") will be raised on an invalid *timespec* argument.

    Example:

    ```
    >>> importdatetimeasdt
    >>> dt.time(hour=12, minute=34, second=56, microsecond=123456).isoformat(timespec='minutes')
    '12:34'
    >>> my_time = dt.time(hour=12, minute=34, second=56, microsecond=0)
    >>> my_time.isoformat(timespec='microseconds')
    '12:34:56.000000'
    >>> my_time.isoformat(timespec='auto')
    '12:34:56'
    ```

    Changed in version 3.6: Added the *timespec* parameter.

time.\_\_str\_\_()
:   For a time `t`, `str(t)` is equivalent to `t.isoformat()`.

time.strftime(*format*)
:   Return a string representing the time, controlled by an explicit format
    string. See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`time.isoformat()`](#datetime.time.isoformat "datetime.time.isoformat").

time.\_\_format\_\_(*format*)
:   Same as [`time.strftime()`](#datetime.time.strftime "datetime.time.strftime"). This makes it possible to specify
    a format string for a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object in [formatted string
    literals](../reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) and when using [`str.format()`](stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format").
    See also [strftime() and strptime() behavior](#strftime-strptime-behavior) and [`time.isoformat()`](#datetime.time.isoformat "datetime.time.isoformat").

time.utcoffset()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.utcoffset(None)`, and raises an exception if the latter doesn’t
    return `None` or a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object with magnitude less than one day.

    Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

time.dst()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.dst(None)`, and raises an exception if the latter doesn’t return
    `None`, or a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object with magnitude less than one day.

    Changed in version 3.7: The DST offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

time.tzname()
:   If [`tzinfo`](#datetime.time.tzinfo "datetime.time.tzinfo") is `None`, returns `None`, else returns
    `self.tzinfo.tzname(None)`, or raises an exception if the latter doesn’t
    return `None` or a string object.

### Examples of usage: `time`

Examples of working with a [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> classTZ1(dt.tzinfo):
...     defutcoffset(self, when):
...         return dt.timedelta(hours=1)
...     defdst(self, when):
...         return dt.timedelta(0)
...     deftzname(self, when):
...         return "+01:00"
...     def__repr__(self):
...         return f"{self.__class__.__name__}()"
...
>>> t = dt.time(12, 10, 30, tzinfo=TZ1())
>>> t
datetime.time(12, 10, 30, tzinfo=TZ1())
>>> t.isoformat()
'12:10:30+01:00'
>>> t.dst()
datetime.timedelta(0)
>>> t.tzname()
'+01:00'
>>> t.strftime("%H:%M:%S %Z")
'12:10:30 +01:00'
>>> 'The {} is {:%H:%M}.'.format("time", t)
'The time is 12:10.'
```

## `tzinfo` objects

*class*datetime.tzinfo
:   This is an [abstract base class](../glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class), meaning that this class should not be
    instantiated directly. Define a subclass of `tzinfo` to capture
    information about a particular time zone.

    An instance of (a concrete subclass of) `tzinfo` can be passed to the
    constructors for [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") and [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects. The latter objects
    view their attributes as being in local time, and the `tzinfo` object
    supports methods revealing offset of local time from UTC, the name of the time
    zone, and DST offset, all relative to a date or time object passed to them.

    You need to derive a concrete subclass, and (at least)
    supply implementations of the standard `tzinfo` methods needed by the
    [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") methods you use. The `datetime` module provides
    [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone"), a simple concrete subclass of `tzinfo` which can
    represent time zones with fixed offset from UTC such as UTC itself or North
    American EST and EDT.

    Special requirement for pickling: A `tzinfo` subclass must have an
    [`__init__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__") method that can be called with no arguments,
    otherwise it can be
    pickled but possibly not unpickled again. This is a technical requirement that
    may be relaxed in the future.

    A concrete subclass of `tzinfo` may need to implement the following
    methods. Exactly which methods are needed depends on the uses made of aware
    `datetime` objects. If in doubt, simply implement all of them.

tzinfo.utcoffset(*dt*)
:   Return offset of local time from UTC, as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object that is
    positive east of UTC. If local time is west of UTC, this should be negative.

    This represents the *total* offset from UTC; for example, if a
    [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") object represents both time zone and DST adjustments,
    `utcoffset()` should return their sum. If the UTC offset isn’t known,
    return `None`. Else the value returned must be a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object
    strictly between `-timedelta(hours=24)` and `timedelta(hours=24)`
    (the magnitude of the offset must be less than one day). Most implementations
    of `utcoffset()` will probably look like one of these two:

    ```
    return CONSTANT                 # fixed-offset class
    return CONSTANT + self.dst(dt)  # daylight-aware class
    ```

    If `utcoffset()` does not return `None`, [`dst()`](#datetime.tzinfo.dst "datetime.tzinfo.dst") should not return
    `None` either.

    The default implementation of `utcoffset()` raises
    [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError").

    Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

tzinfo.dst(*dt*)
:   Return the daylight saving time (DST) adjustment, as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta")
    object or
    `None` if DST information isn’t known.

    Return `timedelta(0)` if DST is not in effect.
    If DST is in effect, return the offset as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object
    (see [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.tzinfo.utcoffset "datetime.tzinfo.utcoffset") for details). Note that DST offset, if applicable, has
    already been added to the UTC offset returned by `utcoffset()`, so there’s
    no need to consult `dst()` unless you’re interested in obtaining DST info
    separately. For example, [`datetime.timetuple()`](#datetime.datetime.timetuple "datetime.datetime.timetuple") calls its [`tzinfo`](#datetime.datetime.tzinfo "datetime.datetime.tzinfo")
    attribute’s `dst()` method to determine how the [`tm_isdst`](time.html#time.struct_time.tm_isdst "time.struct_time.tm_isdst") flag
    should be set, and [`tzinfo.fromutc()`](#datetime.tzinfo.fromutc "datetime.tzinfo.fromutc") calls `dst()` to account for
    DST changes when crossing time zones.

    An instance *tz* of a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass that models both standard and
    daylight times must be consistent in this sense:

    `tz.utcoffset(dt) - tz.dst(dt)`

    must return the same result for every [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") *dt* with `dt.tzinfo ==
    tz`. For sane `tzinfo` subclasses, this expression yields the time
    zone’s “standard offset”, which should not depend on the date or the time, but
    only on geographic location. The implementation of [`datetime.astimezone()`](#datetime.datetime.astimezone "datetime.datetime.astimezone")
    relies on this, but cannot detect violations; it’s the programmer’s
    responsibility to ensure it. If a `tzinfo` subclass cannot guarantee
    this, it may be able to override the default implementation of
    [`tzinfo.fromutc()`](#datetime.tzinfo.fromutc "datetime.tzinfo.fromutc") to work correctly with `astimezone()` regardless.

    Most implementations of `dst()` will probably look like one of these two:

    ```
    importdatetimeasdt

    defdst(self, when):
        # a fixed-offset class:  doesn't account for DST
        return dt.timedelta(0)
    ```

    or:

    ```
    importdatetimeasdt

    defdst(self, when):
        # Code to set dston and dstoff to the time zone's DST
        # transition times based on the input when.year, and expressed
        # in standard local time.

        if dston <= when.replace(tzinfo=None) < dstoff:
            return dt.timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            return dt.timedelta(0)
    ```

    The default implementation of `dst()` raises [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError").

    Changed in version 3.7: The DST offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

tzinfo.tzname(*dt*)
:   Return the time zone name corresponding to the [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object *dt*, as
    a string. Nothing about string names is defined by the `datetime` module,
    and there’s no requirement that it mean anything in particular. For example,
    `"GMT"`, `"UTC"`, `"-500"`, `"-5:00"`, `"EDT"`, `"US/Eastern"`, `"America/New York"` are all
    valid replies. Return `None` if a string name isn’t known. Note that this is
    a method rather than a fixed string primarily because some [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo")
    subclasses will wish to return different names depending on the specific value
    of *dt* passed, especially if the `tzinfo` class is accounting for
    daylight time.

    The default implementation of `tzname()` raises [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError").

These methods are called by a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") or [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") object, in
response to their methods of the same names. A `datetime` object passes
itself as the argument, and a `time` object passes `None` as the
argument. A [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass’s methods should therefore be prepared to
accept a *dt* argument of `None`, or of class `datetime`.

When `None` is passed, it’s up to the class designer to decide the best
response. For example, returning `None` is appropriate if the class wishes to
say that time objects don’t participate in the [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") protocols. It
may be more useful for `utcoffset(None)` to return the standard UTC offset, as
there is no other convention for discovering the standard offset.

When a [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object is passed in response to a `datetime`
method, `dt.tzinfo` is the same object as *self*. [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") methods can
rely on this, unless user code calls `tzinfo` methods directly. The
intent is that the `tzinfo` methods interpret *dt* as being in local
time, and not need worry about objects in other time zones.

There is one more [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") method that a subclass may wish to override:

tzinfo.fromutc(*dt*)
:   This is called from the default [`datetime.astimezone()`](#datetime.datetime.astimezone "datetime.datetime.astimezone")
    implementation. When called from that, `dt.tzinfo` is *self*, and *dt*’s
    date and time data are to be viewed as expressing a UTC time. The purpose
    of `fromutc()` is to adjust the date and time data, returning an
    equivalent datetime in *self*’s local time.

    Most [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclasses should be able to inherit the default
    `fromutc()` implementation without problems. It’s strong enough to handle
    fixed-offset time zones, and time zones accounting for both standard and
    daylight time, and the latter even if the DST transition times differ in
    different years. An example of a time zone the default `fromutc()`
    implementation may not handle correctly in all cases is one where the standard
    offset (from UTC) depends on the specific date and time passed, which can happen
    for political reasons. The default implementations of [`astimezone()`](#datetime.datetime.astimezone "datetime.datetime.astimezone") and
    `fromutc()` may not produce the result you want if the result is one of the
    hours straddling the moment the standard offset changes.

    Skipping code for error cases, the default `fromutc()` implementation acts
    like:

    ```
    importdatetimeasdt

    deffromutc(self, when):
        # raise ValueError error if when.tzinfo is not self
        dtoff = when.utcoffset()
        dtdst = when.dst()
        # raise ValueError if dtoff is None or dtdst is None
        delta = dtoff - dtdst  # this is self's standard offset
        if delta:
            when += delta   # convert to standard local time
            dtdst = when.dst()
            # raise ValueError if dtdst is None
        if dtdst:
            return when + dtdst
        else:
            return when
    ```

In the following [`tzinfo_examples.py`](../_downloads/6dc1f3f4f0e6ca13cb42ddf4d6cbc8af/tzinfo_examples.py) file there are some examples of

Eastern  = USTimeZone(-5, "Eastern",  "EST", "EDT")
Central  = USTimeZone(-6, "Central",  "CST", "CDT")
Mountain = USTimeZone(-7, "Mountain", "MST", "MDT")
Pacific  = USTimeZone(-8, "Pacific",  "PST", "PDT")
```

Note that there are unavoidable subtleties twice per year in a [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo")
subclass accounting for both standard and daylight time, at the DST transition
points. For concreteness, consider US Eastern (UTC -0500), where EDT begins the
minute after 1:59 (EST) on the second Sunday in March, and ends the minute after
1:59 (EDT) on the first Sunday in November:

```
  UTC   3:MM  4:MM  5:MM  6:MM  7:MM  8:MM
  EST  22:MM 23:MM  0:MM  1:MM  2:MM  3:MM
  EDT  23:MM  0:MM  1:MM  2:MM  3:MM  4:MM

start  22:MM 23:MM  0:MM  1:MM  3:MM  4:MM

  end  23:MM  0:MM  1:MM  1:MM  2:MM  3:MM
```

When DST starts (the “start” line), the local wall clock leaps from 1:59 to
3:00. A wall time of the form 2:MM doesn’t really make sense on that day, so
`astimezone(Eastern)` won’t deliver a result with `hour == 2` on the day DST
begins. For example, at the Spring forward transition of 2016, we get:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> fromtzinfo_examplesimport HOUR, Eastern
>>> u0 = dt.datetime(2016, 3, 13, 5, tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc)
>>> for i in range(4):
...     u = u0 + i*HOUR
...     t = u.astimezone(Eastern)
...     print(u.time(), 'UTC =', t.time(), t.tzname())
...
05:00:00 UTC = 00:00:00 EST
06:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EST
07:00:00 UTC = 03:00:00 EDT
08:00:00 UTC = 04:00:00 EDT
```

When DST ends (the “end” line), there’s a potentially worse problem: there’s an
hour that can’t be spelled unambiguously in local wall time: the last hour of
daylight time. In Eastern, that’s times of the form 5:MM UTC on the day
daylight time ends. The local wall clock leaps from 1:59 (daylight time) back
to 1:00 (standard time) again. Local times of the form 1:MM are ambiguous.
[`astimezone()`](#datetime.datetime.astimezone "datetime.datetime.astimezone") mimics the local clock’s behavior by mapping two adjacent UTC
hours into the same local hour then. In the Eastern example, UTC times of the
form 5:MM and 6:MM both map to 1:MM when converted to Eastern, but earlier times
have the [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute set to 0 and the later times have it set to 1.
For example, at the Fall back transition of 2016, we get:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> fromtzinfo_examplesimport HOUR, Eastern
>>> u0 = dt.datetime(2016, 11, 6, 4, tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc)
>>> for i in range(4):
...     u = u0 + i*HOUR
...     t = u.astimezone(Eastern)
...     print(u.time(), 'UTC =', t.time(), t.tzname(), t.fold)
...
04:00:00 UTC = 00:00:00 EDT 0
05:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EDT 0
06:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EST 1
07:00:00 UTC = 02:00:00 EST 0
```

Note that the [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances that differ only by the value of the
[`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute are considered equal in comparisons.

Applications that can’t bear wall-time ambiguities should explicitly check the
value of the [`fold`](#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute or avoid using hybrid
[`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclasses; there are no ambiguities when using [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone"),
or any other fixed-offset `tzinfo` subclass (such as a class representing
only EST (fixed offset -5 hours), or only EDT (fixed offset -4 hours)).

> :   The `datetime` module has a basic [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") class (for
>     handling arbitrary fixed offsets from UTC) and its [`timezone.utc`](#datetime.timezone.utc "datetime.timezone.utc")

[IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)
:   The Time Zone Database (often called tz, tzdata or zoneinfo) contains code
    and data that represent the history of local time for many representative
    locations around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes
    made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and
    daylight-saving rules.

## `timezone` objects

The [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") class is a subclass of [`tzinfo`](#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo"), each
instance of which represents a time zone defined by a fixed offset from
UTC.

Objects of this class cannot be used to represent time zone information in the
locations where different offsets are used in different days of the year or
where historical changes have been made to civil time.

*class*datetime.timezone(*offset*, *name=None*)
:   The *offset* argument must be specified as a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta")
    object representing the difference between the local time and UTC. It must
    be strictly between `-timedelta(hours=24)` and
    `timedelta(hours=24)`, otherwise [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

    The *name* argument is optional. If specified it must be a string that
    will be used as the value returned by the [`datetime.tzname()`](#datetime.datetime.tzname "datetime.datetime.tzname") method.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

timezone.utcoffset(*dt*)
:   Return the fixed value specified when the [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") instance is
    constructed.

    The *dt* argument is ignored. The return value is a [`timedelta`](#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta")
    instance equal to the difference between the local time and UTC.

    Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

timezone.tzname(*dt*)
:   Return the fixed value specified when the [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") instance
    is constructed.

    If *name* is not provided in the constructor, the name returned by
    `tzname(dt)` is generated from the value of the `offset` as follows. If
    *offset* is `timedelta(0)`, the name is “UTC”, otherwise it is a string in
    the format `UTC±HH:MM`, where ± is the sign of `offset`, HH and MM are
    two digits of `offset.hours` and `offset.minutes` respectively.

    Changed in version 3.6: Name generated from `offset=timedelta(0)` is now plain `'UTC'`, not
    `'UTC+00:00'`.

timezone.dst(*dt*)
:   Always returns `None`.

timezone.fromutc(*dt*)
:   Return `dt + offset`. The *dt* argument must be an aware
    [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instance, with `tzinfo` set to `self`.

Class attributes:

timezone.utc
:   The UTC time zone, `timezone(timedelta(0))`.

## `strftime()` and `strptime()` behavior

[`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date"), [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime"), and [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects all support a
`strftime(format)` method, to create a string representing the time under the
control of an explicit format string.

Conversely, the [`date.strptime()`](#datetime.date.strptime "datetime.date.strptime"), [`datetime.strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") and
[`time.strptime()`](time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") class methods create an object from a string
representing the time and a corresponding format string.

The table below provides a high-level comparison of [`strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime")
versus [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime"):

|  | `strftime` | `strptime` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Usage | Convert object to a string according to a given format | Parse a string into an object given a corresponding format |
| Type of method | Instance method | Class method |
| Signature | `strftime(format)` | `strptime(date_string, format)` |

### `strftime()` and `strptime()` format codes

These methods accept format codes that can be used to parse and format dates:

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> dt.datetime.strptime('31/01/22 23:59:59.999999',
...                      '%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S.%f')
datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999)
>>> _.strftime('%a%d %b %Y, %I:%M%p')
'Mon 31 Jan 2022, 11:59PM'
```

The following is a list of all the format codes that the 1989 C standard
requires, and these work on all platforms with a standard C implementation.

| Directive | Meaning | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `%a` | Weekday as locale’s abbreviated name. | Sun, Mon, …, Sat (en\_US);  So, Mo, …, Sa (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%A` | Weekday as locale’s full name. | Sunday, Monday, …, Saturday (en\_US);  Sonntag, Montag, …, Samstag (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%w` | Weekday as a decimal number, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. | 0, 1, …, 6 |  |
| `%d` | Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number. | 01, 02, …, 31 | (9) |
| `%b` | Month as locale’s abbreviated name. | Jan, Feb, …, Dec (en\_US);  Jan, Feb, …, Dez (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%B` | Month as locale’s full name. | January, February, …, December (en\_US);  Januar, Februar, …, Dezember (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%m` | Month as a zero-padded decimal number. | 01, 02, …, 12 | (9) |
| `%y` | Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, …, 99 | (9) |
| `%Y` | Year with century as a decimal number. | 0001, 0002, …, 2013, 2014, …, 9998, 9999 | (2) |
| `%H` | Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, …, 23 | (9) |
| `%I` | Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number. | 01, 02, …, 12 | (9) |
| `%p` | Locale’s equivalent of either AM or PM. | AM, PM (en\_US);  am, pm (de\_DE) | (1), (3) |
| `%M` | Minute as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, …, 59 | (9) |
| `%S` | Second as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, …, 59 | (4), (9) |
| `%f` | Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded to 6 digits. | 000000, 000001, …, 999999 | (5) |
| `%z` | UTC offset in the form `±HHMM[SS[.ffffff]]` (empty string if the object is naive). | (empty), +0000, -0400, +1030, +063415, -030712.345216 | (6) |
| `%Z` | Time zone name (empty string if the object is naive). | (empty), UTC, GMT | (6) |
| `%j` | Day of the year as a zero-padded decimal number. | 001, 002, …, 366 | (9) |
| `%U` | Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a zero-padded decimal number. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are considered to be in week 0. | 00, 01, …, 53 | (7), (9) |
| `%W` | Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a zero-padded decimal number. All days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0. | 00, 01, …, 53 | (7), (9) |
| `%c` | Locale’s appropriate date and time representation. | Tue Aug 16 21:30:00 1988 (en\_US);  Di 16 Aug 21:30:00 1988 (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%x` | Locale’s appropriate date representation. | 08/16/88 (None);  08/16/1988 (en\_US);  16.08.1988 (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%X` | Locale’s appropriate time representation. | 21:30:00 (en\_US);  21:30:00 (de\_DE) | (1) |
| `%%` | A literal `'%'` character. | % |  |

Several additional directives not required by the C89 standard are included for
convenience. These parameters all correspond to ISO 8601 date values.

| Directive | Meaning | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `%G` | ISO 8601 year with century representing the year that contains the greater part of the ISO week (`%V`). | 0001, 0002, …, 2013, 2014, …, 9998, 9999 | (8) |
| `%u` | ISO 8601 weekday as a decimal number where 1 is Monday. | 1, 2, …, 7 |  |
| `%V` | ISO 8601 week as a decimal number with Monday as the first day of the week. Week 01 is the week containing Jan 4. | 01, 02, …, 53 | (8), (9) |
| `%:z` | UTC offset in the form `±HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]` (empty string if the object is naive). | (empty), +00:00, -04:00, +10:30, +06:34:15, -03:07:12.345216 | (6) |

These may not be available on all platforms when used with the [`strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime")
method. The ISO 8601 year and ISO 8601 week directives are not interchangeable
with the year and week number directives above. Calling [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") with
incomplete or ambiguous ISO 8601 directives will raise a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

The full set of format codes supported varies across platforms, because Python
calls the platform C library’s `strftime()` function, and platform
variations are common. To see the full set of format codes supported on your
platform, consult the *[strftime(3)](https://manpages.debian.org/strftime(3))* documentation. There are also
differences between platforms in handling of unsupported format specifiers.

Added in version 3.6: `%G`, `%u` and `%V` were added.

Added in version 3.12: `%:z` was added.

### Technical detail

Broadly speaking, `d.strftime(fmt)` acts like the [`time`](time.html#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module’s
`time.strftime(fmt, d.timetuple())` although not all objects support a
[`timetuple()`](#datetime.date.timetuple "datetime.date.timetuple") method.

For the [`datetime.strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") and [`date.strptime()`](#datetime.date.strptime "datetime.date.strptime") class methods,
the default value is `1900-01-01T00:00:00.000`: any components not specified
in the format string will be pulled from the default value.

Note

Format strings without separators can be ambiguous for parsing. For
example, with `%Y%m%d`, the string `2026111` may be parsed either as
`2026-11-01` or as `2026-01-11`.
Use separators to ensure the input is parsed as intended.

Note

When used to parse partial dates lacking a year, [`datetime.strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime")
and [`date.strptime()`](#datetime.date.strptime "datetime.date.strptime") will raise when encountering February 29 because
the default year of 1900 is *not* a leap year. Always add a default leap
year to partial date strings before parsing.

```
>>> importdatetimeasdt
>>> value = "2/29"
>>> dt.datetime.strptime(value, "%m/%d")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: day 29 must be in range 1..28 for month 2 in year 1900
>>> dt.datetime.strptime(f"1904 {value}", "%Y %m/%d")
datetime.datetime(1904, 2, 29, 0, 0)
```

Using `datetime.strptime(date_string, format)` is equivalent to:

```
datetime(*(time.strptime(date_string, format)[0:6]))
```

except when the format includes sub-second components or time zone offset
information, which are supported in `datetime.strptime` but are discarded by
`time.strptime`.

For [`time`](#datetime.time "datetime.time") objects, the format codes for year, month, and day should not
be used, as `time` objects have no such values. If they’re used anyway,
1900 is substituted for the year, and 1 for the month and day.

For [`date`](#datetime.date "datetime.date") objects, the format codes for hours, minutes, seconds, and
microseconds should not be used, as `date` objects have no such
values. If they’re used anyway, 0 is substituted for them.

For the same reason, handling of format strings containing Unicode code points
that can’t be represented in the charset of the current locale is also
platform-dependent. On some platforms such code points are preserved intact in
the output, while on others `strftime` may raise [`UnicodeError`](exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError") or return
an empty string instead.

Notes:

1. Because the format depends on the current locale, care should be taken when
   making assumptions about the output value. Field orderings will vary (for
   example, “month/day/year” versus “day/month/year”), and the output may
   contain non-ASCII characters.
2. The [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method can parse years in the full [1, 9999] range, but
   years < 1000 must be zero-filled to 4-digit width.

   Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions, [`strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime") method was restricted to
   years >= 1900.

   Changed in version 3.3: In version 3.2, [`strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime") method was restricted to
   years >= 1000.
3. When used with the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method, the `%p` directive only affects
   the output hour field if the `%I` directive is used to parse the hour.
4. Unlike the [`time`](time.html#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module, the `datetime` module does not support
   leap seconds.
5. When used with the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method, the `%f` directive
   accepts from one to six digits and zero pads on the right. `%f` is
   an extension to the set of format characters in the C standard (but
   implemented separately in datetime objects, and therefore always
   available).
6. For a naive object, the `%z`, `%:z` and `%Z` format codes are replaced
   by empty strings.

   For an aware object:

   `%z`
   :   [`utcoffset()`](#datetime.datetime.utcoffset "datetime.datetime.utcoffset") is transformed into a string of the form
       `±HHMM[SS[.ffffff]]`, where `HH` is a 2-digit string giving the number
       of UTC offset hours, `MM` is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC
       offset minutes, `SS` is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset
       seconds and `ffffff` is a 6-digit string giving the number of UTC
       offset microseconds. The `ffffff` part is omitted when the offset is a
       whole number of seconds and both the `ffffff` and the `SS` part is
       omitted when the offset is a whole number of minutes. For example, if
       `utcoffset()` returns `timedelta(hours=-3, minutes=-30)`, `%z` is
       replaced with the string `'-0330'`.

   Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

   Changed in version 3.7: When the `%z` directive is provided to the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method,
   the UTC offsets can have a colon as a separator between hours, minutes
   and seconds.
   For example, `'+01:00:00'` will be parsed as an offset of one hour.
   In addition, providing `'Z'` is identical to `'+00:00'`.

   `%:z`
   :   Behaves exactly as `%z`, but has a colon separator added between
       hours, minutes and seconds.

   `%Z`
   :   In [`strftime()`](#datetime.datetime.strftime "datetime.datetime.strftime"), `%Z` is replaced by an empty string if
       [`tzname()`](#datetime.datetime.tzname "datetime.datetime.tzname") returns `None`; otherwise `%Z` is replaced by the
       returned value, which must be a string.

       [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") only accepts certain values for `%Z`:

       1. any value in `time.tzname` for your machine’s locale
       2. the hard-coded values `UTC` and `GMT`

       So someone living in Japan may have `JST`, `UTC`, and `GMT` as
       valid values, but probably not `EST`. It will raise `ValueError` for
       invalid values.

   Changed in version 3.2: When the `%z` directive is provided to the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method, an
   aware [`datetime`](#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") object will be produced. The `tzinfo` of the
   result will be set to a [`timezone`](#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") instance.
7. When used with the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method, `%U` and `%W` are only used
   in calculations when the day of the week and the calendar year (`%Y`)
   are specified.
8. Similar to `%U` and `%W`, `%V` is only used in calculations when the
   day of the week and the ISO year (`%G`) are specified in a
   [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") format string. Also note that `%G` and `%Y` are not
   interchangeable.
9. When used with the [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") method, the leading zero is optional
   for formats `%d`, `%m`, `%H`, `%I`, `%M`, `%S`, `%j`, `%U`,
   `%W`, and `%V`. Format `%y` does require a leading zero.
10. When parsing a month and day using [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime"), always
    include a year in the format. If the value you need to parse lacks a year,
    append an explicit dummy leap year. Otherwise your code will raise an
    exception when it encounters leap day because the default year used by the
    parser (1900) is not a leap year. Users run into that bug every leap year.

    ```
    >>> month_day = "02/29"
    >>> dt.datetime.strptime(f"{month_day};1984", "%m/%d;%Y")  # No leap year bug.
    datetime.datetime(1984, 2, 29, 0, 0)
    ```

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: [`strptime()`](#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") calls using a format string containing
    a day of month without a year now emit a
    [`DeprecationWarning`](exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"). In 3.15 or later we may change this into
    an error or change the default year to a leap year. See [gh-70647](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/70647).
