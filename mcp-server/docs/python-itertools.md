## 1. `itertools` — Functions creating iterators for efficient looping

---

This module implements a number of [iterator](../glossary.html#term-iterator) building blocks inspired
by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form
suitable for Python.

The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are
useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator
algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and
efficiently in pure Python.

For instance, SML provides a tabulation tool: `tabulate(f)` which produces a
sequence `f(0), f(1), ...`. The same effect can be achieved in Python
by combining [`map()`](functions.html#map "map") and [`count()`](#itertools.count "itertools.count") to form `map(f, count())`.

**General iterators:**

## Itertool Functions

The following functions all construct and return iterators. Some provide
streams of infinite length, so they should only be accessed by functions or
loops that truncate the stream.

itertools.accumulate(*iterable*[, *function*, *\**, *initial=None*])
:   Make an iterator that returns accumulated sums or accumulated
    results from other binary functions.

    The *function* defaults to addition. The *function* should accept
    two arguments, an accumulated total and a value from the *iterable*.

    If an *initial* value is provided, the accumulation will start with
    that value and the output will have one more element than the input
    iterable.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defaccumulate(iterable, function=operator.add, *, initial=None):
        'Return running totals'
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5]) → 1 3 6 10 15
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5], initial=100) → 100 101 103 106 110 115
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5], operator.mul) → 1 2 6 24 120

        iterator = iter(iterable)
        total = initial
        if initial is None:
            try:
                total = next(iterator)
            except StopIteration:
                return

        yield total
        for element in iterator:
            total = function(total, element)
            yield total
    ```

    To compute a running minimum, set *function* to [`min()`](functions.html#min "min").
    For a running maximum, set *function* to [`max()`](functions.html#max "max").
    Or for a running product, set *function* to [`operator.mul()`](operator.html#operator.mul "operator.mul").
    To build an [amortization table](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/amortization-schedule),
    accumulate the interest and apply payments:

    ```
    >>> data = [3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 9, 0, 7, 5, 8]
    >>> list(accumulate(data, max))              # running maximum
    [3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
    >>> list(accumulate(data, operator.mul))     # running product
    [3, 12, 72, 144, 144, 1296, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    # Amortize a 5% loan of 1000 with 10 annual payments of 90
    >>> update = lambda balance, payment: round(balance * 1.05) - payment
    >>> list(accumulate(repeat(90, 10), update, initial=1_000))
    [1000, 960, 918, 874, 828, 779, 728, 674, 618, 559, 497]
    ```

    See [`functools.reduce()`](functools.html#functools.reduce "functools.reduce") for a similar function that returns only the
    final accumulated value.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the optional *function* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.8: Added the optional *initial* parameter.

itertools.batched(*iterable*, *n*, *\**, *strict=False*)
:   Batch data from the *iterable* into tuples of length *n*. The last
    batch may be shorter than *n*.

    If *strict* is true, will raise a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the final
    batch is shorter than *n*.

    Loops over the input iterable and accumulates data into tuples up to
    size *n*. The input is consumed lazily, just enough to fill a batch.
    The result is yielded as soon as the batch is full or when the input
    iterable is exhausted:

    ```
    >>> flattened_data = ['roses', 'red', 'violets', 'blue', 'sugar', 'sweet']
    >>> unflattened = list(batched(flattened_data, 2))
    >>> unflattened
    [('roses', 'red'), ('violets', 'blue'), ('sugar', 'sweet')]
    ```

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defbatched(iterable, n, *, strict=False):
        # batched('ABCDEFG', 3) → ABC DEF G
        if n < 1:
            raise ValueError('n must be at least one')
        iterator = iter(iterable)
        while batch := tuple(islice(iterator, n)):
            if strict and len(batch) != n:
                raise ValueError('batched(): incomplete batch')
            yield batch
    ```

    Added in version 3.12.

    Changed in version 3.13: Added the *strict* option.

itertools.chain(*\*iterables*)
:   Make an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until
    it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the
    iterables are exhausted. This combines multiple data sources into a
    single iterator. Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defchain(*iterables):
        # chain('ABC', 'DEF') → A B C D E F
        for iterable in iterables:
            yield from iterable
    ```

*classmethod*chain.from\_iterable(*iterable*)
:   Alternate constructor for [`chain()`](#itertools.chain "itertools.chain"). Gets chained inputs from a
    single iterable argument that is evaluated lazily. Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    deffrom_iterable(iterables):
        # chain.from_iterable(['ABC', 'DEF']) → A B C D E F
        for iterable in iterables:
            yield from iterable
    ```

itertools.combinations(*iterable*, *r*)
:   Return *r* length subsequences of elements from the input *iterable*.

    The output is a subsequence of [`product()`](#itertools.product "itertools.product") keeping only entries that
    are subsequences of the *iterable*. The length of the output is given
    by [`math.comb()`](math.html#math.comb "math.comb") which computes `n! / r! / (n - r)!` when `0 ≤ r
    ≤ n` or zero when `r > n`.

    The combination tuples are emitted in lexicographic order according to
    the order of the input *iterable*. If the input *iterable* is sorted,
    the output tuples will be produced in sorted order.

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
    value. If the input elements are unique, there will be no repeated
    values within each combination.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defcombinations(iterable, r):
        # combinations('ABCD', 2) → AB AC AD BC BD CD
        # combinations(range(4), 3) → 012 013 023 123

        pool = tuple(iterable)
        n = len(pool)
        if r > n:
            return
        indices = list(range(r))

        yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)
        while True:
            for i in reversed(range(r)):
                if indices[i] != i + n - r:
                    break
            else:
                return
            indices[i] += 1
            for j in range(i+1, r):
                indices[j] = indices[j-1] + 1
            yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)
    ```

itertools.combinations\_with\_replacement(*iterable*, *r*)
:   Return *r* length subsequences of elements from the input *iterable*
    allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once.

    The output is a subsequence of [`product()`](#itertools.product "itertools.product") that keeps only entries
    that are subsequences (with possible repeated elements) of the
    *iterable*. The number of subsequence returned is `(n + r - 1)! / r! /
    (n - 1)!` when `n > 0`.

    The combination tuples are emitted in lexicographic order according to
    the order of the input *iterable*. if the input *iterable* is sorted,
    the output tuples will be produced in sorted order.

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
    value. If the input elements are unique, the generated combinations
    will also be unique.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defcombinations_with_replacement(iterable, r):
        # combinations_with_replacement('ABC', 2) → AA AB AC BB BC CC

        pool = tuple(iterable)
        n = len(pool)
        if not n and r:
            return
        indices = [0] * r

        yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)
        while True:
            for i in reversed(range(r)):
                if indices[i] != n - 1:
                    break
            else:
                return
            indices[i:] = [indices[i] + 1] * (r - i)
            yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)
    ```

    Added in version 3.1.

itertools.compress(*data*, *selectors*)
:   Make an iterator that returns elements from *data* where the
    corresponding element in *selectors* is true. Stops when either the
    *data* or *selectors* iterables have been exhausted. Roughly
    equivalent to:

    ```
    defcompress(data, selectors):
        # compress('ABCDEF', [1,0,1,0,1,1]) → A C E F
        return (datum for datum, selector in zip(data, selectors) if selector)
    ```

    Added in version 3.1.

itertools.count(*start=0*, *step=1*)
:   Make an iterator that returns evenly spaced values beginning with
    *start*. Can be used with [`map()`](functions.html#map "map") to generate consecutive data
    points or with [`zip()`](functions.html#zip "zip") to add sequence numbers. Roughly
    equivalent to:

    ```
    defcount(start=0, step=1):
        # count(10) → 10 11 12 13 14 ...
        # count(2.5, 0.5) → 2.5 3.0 3.5 ...
        n = start
        while True:
            yield n
            n += step
    ```

    When counting with floating-point numbers, better accuracy can sometimes be
    achieved by substituting multiplicative code such as: `(start + step * i
    for i in count())`.

    Changed in version 3.1: Added *step* argument and allowed non-integer arguments.

itertools.cycle(*iterable*)
:   Make an iterator returning elements from the *iterable* and saving a
    copy of each. When the iterable is exhausted, return elements from
    the saved copy. Repeats indefinitely. Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defcycle(iterable):
        # cycle('ABCD') → A B C D A B C D A B C D ...

        saved = []
        for element in iterable:
            yield element
            saved.append(element)

        while saved:
            for element in saved:
                yield element
    ```

    This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on
    the length of the iterable).

itertools.dropwhile(*predicate*, *iterable*)
:   Make an iterator that drops elements from the *iterable* while the
    *predicate* is true and afterwards returns every element. Roughly
    equivalent to:

    ```
    defdropwhile(predicate, iterable):
        # dropwhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,3,8]) → 6 3 8

        iterator = iter(iterable)
        for x in iterator:
            if not predicate(x):
                yield x
                break

        for x in iterator:
            yield x
    ```

    Note this does not produce *any* output until the predicate first
    becomes false, so this itertool may have a lengthy start-up time.

itertools.filterfalse(*predicate*, *iterable*)
:   Make an iterator that filters elements from the *iterable* returning
    only those for which the *predicate* returns a false value. If
    *predicate* is `None`, returns the items that are false. Roughly
    equivalent to:

    ```
    deffilterfalse(predicate, iterable):
        # filterfalse(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,3,8]) → 6 8

        if predicate is None:
            predicate = bool

        for x in iterable:
            if not predicate(x):
                yield x
    ```

itertools.groupby(*iterable*, *key=None*)
:   Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the *iterable*.
    The *key* is a function computing a key value for each element. If not
    specified or is `None`, *key* defaults to an identity function and returns
    the element unchanged. Generally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on
    the same key function.

    The operation of `groupby()` is similar to the `uniq` filter in Unix. It
    generates a break or new group every time the value of the key function changes
    (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted the data using the same key
    function). That behavior differs from SQL’s GROUP BY which aggregates common
    elements regardless of their input order.

    The returned group is itself an iterator that shares the underlying iterable
    with `groupby()`. Because the source is shared, when the `groupby()`
    object is advanced, the previous group is no longer visible. So, if that data
    is needed later, it should be stored as a list:

    ```
    groups = []
    uniquekeys = []
    data = sorted(data, key=keyfunc)
    for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
        groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list
        uniquekeys.append(k)
    ```

    `groupby()` is roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defgroupby(iterable, key=None):
        # [k for k, g in groupby('AAAABBBCCDAABBB')] → A B C D A B
        # [list(g) for k, g in groupby('AAAABBBCCD')] → AAAA BBB CC D

        keyfunc = (lambda x: x) if key is None else key
        iterator = iter(iterable)
        exhausted = False

        def_grouper(target_key):
            nonlocal curr_value, curr_key, exhausted
            yield curr_value
            for curr_value in iterator:
                curr_key = keyfunc(curr_value)
                if curr_key != target_key:
                    return
                yield curr_value
            exhausted = True

        try:
            curr_value = next(iterator)
        except StopIteration:
            return
        curr_key = keyfunc(curr_value)

        while not exhausted:
            target_key = curr_key
            curr_group = _grouper(target_key)
            yield curr_key, curr_group
            if curr_key == target_key:
                for _ in curr_group:
                    pass
    ```

itertools.islice(*iterable*, *stop*)

itertools.islice(*iterable*, *start*, *stop*[, *step*])
:   Make an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable.
    Works like sequence slicing but does not support negative values for
    *start*, *stop*, or *step*.

    If *start* is zero or `None`, iteration starts at zero. Otherwise,
    elements from the iterable are skipped until *start* is reached.

    If *stop* is `None`, iteration continues until the input is
    exhausted, if at all. Otherwise, it stops at the specified position.

    If *step* is `None`, the step defaults to one. Elements are returned
    consecutively unless *step* is set higher than one which results in
    items being skipped.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defislice(iterable, *args):
        # islice('ABCDEFG', 2) → A B
        # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, 4) → C D
        # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, None) → C D E F G
        # islice('ABCDEFG', 0, None, 2) → A C E G

        s = slice(*args)
        start = 0 if s.start is None else s.start
        stop = s.stop
        step = 1 if s.step is None else s.step
        if start < 0 or (stop is not None and stop < 0) or step <= 0:
            raise ValueError

        indices = count() if stop is None else range(max(start, stop))
        next_i = start
        for i, element in zip(indices, iterable):
            if i == next_i:
                yield element
                next_i += step
    ```

    If the input is an iterator, then fully consuming the *islice*
    advances the input iterator by `max(start, stop)` steps regardless
    of the *step* value.

itertools.pairwise(*iterable*)
:   Return successive overlapping pairs taken from the input *iterable*.

    The number of 2-tuples in the output iterator will be one fewer than the
    number of inputs. It will be empty if the input iterable has fewer than
    two values.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defpairwise(iterable):
        # pairwise('ABCDEFG') → AB BC CD DE EF FG

        iterator = iter(iterable)
        a = next(iterator, None)

        for b in iterator:
            yield a, b
            a = b
    ```

    Added in version 3.10.

itertools.permutations(*iterable*, *r=None*)
:   Return successive *r* length [permutations of elements](https://www.britannica.com/science/permutation) from the *iterable*.

    If *r* is not specified or is `None`, then *r* defaults to the length
    of the *iterable* and all possible full-length permutations
    are generated.

    The output is a subsequence of [`product()`](#itertools.product "itertools.product") where entries with
    repeated elements have been filtered out. The length of the output is
    given by [`math.perm()`](math.html#math.perm "math.perm") which computes `n! / (n - r)!` when
    `0 ≤ r ≤ n` or zero when `r > n`.

    The permutation tuples are emitted in lexicographic order according to
    the order of the input *iterable*. If the input *iterable* is sorted,
    the output tuples will be produced in sorted order.

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
    value. If the input elements are unique, there will be no repeated
    values within a permutation.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```

itertools.product(*\*iterables*, *repeat=1*)
:   [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)
    of the input iterables.

    Roughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example,
    `product(A, B)` returns the same as `((x,y) for x in A for y in B)`.

    The nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element advancing
    on every iteration. This pattern creates a lexicographic ordering so that if
    the input’s iterables are sorted, the product tuples are emitted in sorted
    order.

    To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number of
    repetitions with the optional *repeat* keyword argument. For example,
    `product(A, repeat=4)` means the same as `product(A, A, A, A)`.

    This function is roughly equivalent to the following code, except that the
    actual implementation does not build up intermediate results in memory:

    ```
    defproduct(*iterables, repeat=1):
        # product('ABCD', 'xy') → Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx Dy
        # product(range(2), repeat=3) → 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

        if repeat < 0:
            raise ValueError('repeat argument cannot be negative')
        pools = [tuple(pool) for pool in iterables] * repeat

        result = [[]]
        for pool in pools:
            result = [x+[y] for x in result for y in pool]

        for prod in result:
            yield tuple(prod)
    ```

    Before `product()` runs, it completely consumes the input iterables,
    keeping pools of values in memory to generate the products. Accordingly,
    it is only useful with finite inputs.

itertools.repeat(*object*[, *times*])
:   Make an iterator that returns *object* over and over again. Runs indefinitely
    unless the *times* argument is specified.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defrepeat(object, times=None):
        # repeat(10, 3) → 10 10 10
        if times is None:
            while True:
                yield object
        else:
            for i in range(times):
                yield object
    ```

    A common use for *repeat* is to supply a stream of constant values to *map*
    or *zip*:

    ```
    >>> list(map(pow, range(10), repeat(2)))
    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    ```

itertools.starmap(*function*, *iterable*)
:   Make an iterator that computes the *function* using arguments obtained
    from the *iterable*. Used instead of [`map()`](functions.html#map "map") when argument
    parameters have already been “pre-zipped” into tuples.

    The difference between [`map()`](functions.html#map "map") and `starmap()` parallels the
    distinction between `function(a,b)` and `function(*c)`. Roughly
    equivalent to:

    ```
    defstarmap(function, iterable):
        # starmap(pow, [(2,5), (3,2), (10,3)]) → 32 9 1000
        for args in iterable:
            yield function(*args)
    ```

itertools.takewhile(*predicate*, *iterable*)
:   Make an iterator that returns elements from the *iterable* as long as
    the *predicate* is true. Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    deftakewhile(predicate, iterable):
        # takewhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,3,8]) → 1 4
        for x in iterable:
            if not predicate(x):
                break
            yield x
    ```

    Note, the element that first fails the predicate condition is
    consumed from the input iterator and there is no way to access it.
    This could be an issue if an application wants to further consume the
    input iterator after *takewhile* has been run to exhaustion. To work
    around this problem, consider using [more-itertools before\_and\_after()](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.before_and_after)
    instead.

itertools.tee(*iterable*, *n=2*)
:   Return *n* independent iterators from a single iterable.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    deftee(iterable, n=2):
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError
        if n == 0:
            return ()
        iterator = _tee(iterable)
        result = [iterator]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            result.append(_tee(iterator))
        return tuple(result)

    class_tee:

        def__init__(self, iterable):
            it = iter(iterable)
            if isinstance(it, _tee):
                self.iterator = it.iterator
                self.link = it.link
            else:
                self.iterator = it
                self.link = [None, None]

        def__iter__(self):
            return self

        def__next__(self):
            link = self.link
            if link[1] is None:
                link[0] = next(self.iterator)
                link[1] = [None, None]
            value, self.link = link
            return value
    ```

    When the input *iterable* is already a tee iterator object, all
    members of the return tuple are constructed as if they had been
    produced by the upstream `tee()` call. This “flattening step”
    allows nested `tee()` calls to share the same underlying data
    chain and to have a single update step rather than a chain of calls.

    The flattening property makes tee iterators efficiently peekable:

    ```
    deflookahead(tee_iterator):
         "Return the next value without moving the input forward"
         [forked_iterator] = tee(tee_iterator, 1)
         return next(forked_iterator)
    ```

    ```
    >>> iterator = iter('abcdef')
    >>> [iterator] = tee(iterator, 1)   # Make the input peekable
    >>> next(iterator)                  # Move the iterator forward
    'a'
    >>> lookahead(iterator)             # Check next value
    'b'
    >>> next(iterator)                  # Continue moving forward
    'b'
    ```

    `tee` iterators are not threadsafe. A [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") may be
    raised when simultaneously using iterators returned by the same `tee()`
    call, even if the original *iterable* is threadsafe.

    This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on how
    much temporary data needs to be stored). In general, if one iterator uses
    most or all of the data before another iterator starts, it is faster to use
    [`list()`](stdtypes.html#list "list") instead of `tee()`.

itertools.zip\_longest(*\*iterables*, *fillvalue=None*)
:   Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the
    *iterables*.

    If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in
    with *fillvalue*. If not specified, *fillvalue* defaults to `None`.

    Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    defzip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None):
        # zip_longest('ABCD', 'xy', fillvalue='-') → Ax By C- D-

        iterators = list(map(iter, iterables))
        num_active = len(iterators)
        if not num_active:
            return

        while True:
            values = []
            for i, iterator in enumerate(iterators):
                try:
                    value = next(iterator)
                except StopIteration:
                    num_active -= 1
                    if not num_active:
                        return
                    iterators[i] = repeat(fillvalue)
                    value = fillvalue
                values.append(value)
            yield tuple(values)
    ```

    If one of the iterables is potentially infinite, then the `zip_longest()`
    function should be wrapped with something that limits the number of calls
    (for example [`islice()`](#itertools.islice "itertools.islice") or [`takewhile()`](#itertools.takewhile "itertools.takewhile")).

## Itertools Recipes

This section shows recipes for creating an extended toolset using the existing
itertools as building blocks.

The primary purpose of the itertools recipes is educational. The recipes show
various ways of thinking about individual tools — for example, that
`chain.from_iterable` is related to the concept of flattening. The recipes
also give ideas about ways that the tools can be combined — for example, how
`starmap()` and `repeat()` can work together. The recipes also show patterns
for using itertools with the [`operator`](operator.html#module-operator "operator: Functions corresponding to the standard operators.") and [`collections`](collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") modules as
well as with the built-in itertools such as `map()`, `filter()`,
`reversed()`, and `enumerate()`.

A secondary purpose of the recipes is to serve as an incubator. The
`accumulate()`, `compress()`, and `pairwise()` itertools started out as
recipes. Currently, the `sliding_window()`, `derangements()`, and `sieve()`
recipes are being tested to see whether they prove their worth.

Substantially all of these recipes and many, many others can be installed from
the [more-itertools](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/) project found
on the Python Package Index:

```
python -m pip install more-itertools
```

Many of the recipes offer the same high performance as the underlying toolset.
Superior memory performance is kept by processing elements one at a time rather
than bringing the whole iterable into memory all at once. Code volume is kept
small by linking the tools together in a [functional style](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf). High speed
is retained by preferring “vectorized” building blocks over the use of for-loops
and [generators](../glossary.html#term-generator) which incur interpreter overhead.
