The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) connects LLMs to tools and data. FastMCP gives you everything you need to go from prototype to production:
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")
@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
"""Add two numbers"""
return a + b
if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":
mcp.run()
```
## Why FastMCP
Building an effective MCP application is harder than it looks. FastMCP handles all of it. Declare a tool with a Python function, and the schema, validation, and documentation are generated automatically. Connect to a server with a URL, and transport negotiation, authentication, and protocol lifecycle are managed for you. You focus on your logic, and the MCP part just works: \*\*with FastMCP, best practices are built in.\*\*
\*\*That's why FastMCP is the standard framework for working with MCP.\*\* FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into the official MCP Python SDK in 2024. Today, the actively maintained standalone project is downloaded a million times a day, and some version of FastMCP powers 70% of MCP servers across all languages.
FastMCP has three pillars:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**Servers**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/server)  Expose tools, resources, and prompts to LLMs. | [**Apps**](https://gofastmcp.com/apps/overview)  Give your tools interactive UIs rendered directly in the conversation. | [**Clients**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client)  Connect to any MCP server — local or remote, programmatic or CLI. |

\*\*[Servers](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/server)\*\* wrap your Python functions into MCP-compliant tools, resources, and prompts. \*\*[Clients](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client)\*\* connect to any server with full protocol support. And \*\*[Apps](https://gofastmcp.com/apps/overview)\*\* give your tools interactive UIs rendered directly in the conversation.

When you're ready to deploy, [Prefect Horizon](https://www.prefect.io/horizon) offers free hosting for FastMCP users.
## Installation
We recommend installing FastMCP with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
uv pip install fastmcp
```
For full installation instructions, including verification and upgrading, see the [\*\*Installation Guide\*\*](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation).
\*\*Upgrading?\*\* We have guides for:
- [Upgrading from FastMCP v2](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2)
- [Upgrading from the MCP Python SDK](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk)
- [Upgrading from the low-level SDK](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-low-level-sdk)
## 📚 Documentation
FastMCP's complete documentation is available at \*\*[gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com)\*\*, including detailed guides, API references, and advanced patterns.
Documentation is also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/), which is a simple markdown standard that LLMs can consume easily:
- [`llms.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) is essentially a sitemap, listing all the pages in the documentation.
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) contains the entire documentation. Note this may exceed the context window of your LLM.
